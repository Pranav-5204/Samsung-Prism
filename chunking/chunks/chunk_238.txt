Non-dialog-
         stateful proxies, of course, have no concept of when the dialog
         has terminated, but they MAY encode enough information in the
         value to compare it against the dialog identifier of future
         requests and MAY reject requests not matching that information. Endpoints MUST NOT use a URI obtained from a Record-Route
         header field outside the dialog in which it was provided. See          Section 12 for more information on an endpointâ€™s use of
         Record-Route header fields. Record-routing may be required by certain services where the
         proxy needs to observe all messages in a dialog. However, it
         slows down processing and impairs scalability and thus proxies
         should only record-route if required for a particular service. The Record-Route process is designed to work for any SIP
         request that initiates a dialog.
