RFC 2617 [17] defines mechanisms for
   backwards compatibility using the qop attribute in the request. These mechanisms MUST be used by a server to determine if the client
   supports the new mechanisms in RFC 2617 that were not specified in
   RFC 2069. 23 S/MIME
   SIP messages carry MIME bodies and the MIME standard includes
   mechanisms for securing MIME contents to ensure both integrity and
   confidentiality (including the ’multipart/signed’ and
   ’application/pkcs7-mime’ MIME types, see RFC 1847 [22], RFC 2630 [23]
   and RFC 2633 [24]). Implementers should note, however, that there
   may be rare network intermediaries (not typical proxy servers) that
   rely on viewing or modifying the bodies of SIP messages (especially
   SDP), and that secure MIME may prevent these sorts of intermediaries
   from functioning. This applies particularly to certain types of firewalls.
