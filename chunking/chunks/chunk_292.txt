The
   server transaction filters any request retransmissions from the
   network. The server transaction accepts responses from the TU and
   delivers them to the transport layer for transmission over the
   network. In the case of an INVITE transaction, it absorbs the ACK
   request for any final response excepting a 2xx response. The 2xx response and its ACK receive special treatment. This
   response is retransmitted only by a UAS, and its ACK generated only
   by the UAC. This end-to-end treatment is needed so that a caller
   knows the entire set of users that have accepted the call. Because
   of this special handling, retransmissions of the 2xx response are
   handled by the UA core, not the transaction layer. Similarly,
   generation of the ACK for the 2xx is handled by the UA core. Each
   proxy along the path merely forwards each 2xx response to INVITE and
   its corresponding ACK.
