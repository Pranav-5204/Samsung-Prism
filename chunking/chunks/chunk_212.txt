It forwards each request downstream to a single element
   determined by making a targeting and routing decision based on the
   request. It simply forwards every response it receives upstream. A
   stateless proxy discards information about a message once the message
   has been forwarded. A stateful proxy remembers information
   (specifically, transaction state) about each incoming request and any
   requests it sends as a result of processing the incoming request. It
   uses this information to affect the processing of future messages
   associated with that request. A stateful proxy MAY choose to "fork"
   a request, routing it to multiple destinations. Any request that is
   forwarded to more than one location MUST be handled statefully. In some circumstances, a proxy MAY forward requests using stateful
   transports (such as TCP) without being transaction-stateful.
