Note that a Contact header field value MAY also refer to a different
   resource than the one originally called. For example, a SIP call
   connected to PSTN gateway may need to deliver a special informational
   announcement such as "The number you have dialed has been changed." A Contact response header field can contain any suitable URI
   indicating where the called party can be reached, not limited to SIP
   URIs. For example, it could contain URIs for phones, fax, or irc (if
   they were defined) or a mailto:  (RFC 2368 [32]) URL. Section 26.4.4
   discusses implications and limitations of redirecting a SIPS URI to a
   non-SIPS URI. The "expires" parameter of a Contact header field value indicates how
   long the URI is valid. The value of the parameter is a number
   indicating seconds. If this parameter is not provided, the value of
   the Expires header field determines how long the URI is valid. Malformed values SHOULD be treated as equivalent to 3600.
