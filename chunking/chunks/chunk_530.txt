However, SIP
   requests and responses cannot be naively encrypted end-to-end in
   their entirety because message fields such as the Request-URI, Route,
   and Via need to be visible to proxies in most network architectures
   so that SIP requests are routed correctly. Note that proxy servers
   need to modify some features of messages as well (such as adding Via
   header field values) in order for SIP to function. Proxy servers
   must therefore be trusted, to some degree, by SIP UAs. To this
   purpose, low-layer security mechanisms for SIP are recommended, which    encrypt the entire SIP requests or responses on the wire on a hop-
   by-hop basis, and that allow endpoints to verify the identity of
   proxy servers to whom they send requests. SIP entities also have a need to identify one another in a secure
   fashion. When a SIP endpoint asserts the identity of its user to a
   peer UA or to a proxy server, that identity should in some way be
   verifiable.
