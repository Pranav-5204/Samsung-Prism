The remainder of the processing described in this section is
         not performed on this message, the UAC processing rules
         described in Section 8.1.3 are followed instead (transport
         layer processing has already occurred). This will happen, for instance, when the element generates
         CANCEL requests as described in Section 10. 4. Add response to context
         Final responses received are stored in the response context
         until a final response is generated on the server transaction
         associated with this context. The response may be a candidate
         for the best final response to be returned on that server
         transaction. Information from this response may be needed in
         forming the best response, even if this response is not chosen.
