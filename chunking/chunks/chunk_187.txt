The UAC core MUST generate an ACK request for each 2xx received from
   the transaction layer. The header fields of the ACK are constructed
   in the same way as for any request sent within a dialog (see Section
   12) with the exception of the CSeq and the header fields related to
   authentication. The sequence number of the CSeq header field MUST be
   the same as the INVITE being acknowledged, but the CSeq method MUST
   be ACK. The ACK MUST contain the same credentials as the INVITE. If
   the 2xx contains an offer (based on the rules above), the ACK MUST
   carry an answer in its body. If the offer in the 2xx response is not
   acceptable, the UAC core MUST generate a valid answer in the ACK and
   then send a BYE immediately. Once the ACK has been constructed, the procedures of [4] are used to
   determine the destination address, port and transport. However, the
   request is passed to the transport layer directly for transmission,
   rather than a client transaction.
