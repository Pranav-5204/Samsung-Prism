Check response for forwarding
         Until a final response has been sent on the server transaction,
         the following responses MUST be forwarded immediately:
         -  Any provisional response other than 100 (Trying)
         -  Any 2xx response
         If a 6xx response is received, it is not immediately forwarded,
         but the stateful proxy SHOULD cancel all client pending
         transactions as described in Section 10, and it MUST NOT create
         any new branches in this context. This is a change from RFC 2543, which mandated that the proxy
         was to forward the 6xx response immediately. For an INVITE
         transaction, this approach had the problem that a 2xx response
         could arrive on another branch, in which case the proxy would          have to forward the 2xx. The result was that the UAC could
         receive a 6xx response followed by a 2xx response, which should
         never be allowed to happen.
