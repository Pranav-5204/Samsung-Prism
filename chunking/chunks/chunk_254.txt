If a proxy receives a 416 (Unsupported URI Scheme) response to
         a request whose Request-URI scheme was not SIP, but the scheme
         in the original received request was SIP or SIPS (that is, the
         proxy changed the scheme from SIP or SIPS to something else
         when it proxied a request), the proxy SHOULD add a new URI to
         the target set. This URI SHOULD be a SIP URI version of the
         non-SIP URI that was just tried. In the case of the tel URL,
         this is accomplished by placing the telephone-subscriber part
         of the tel URL into the user part of the SIP URI, and setting
         the hostpart to the domain where the prior request was sent. See Section 19.1.6 for more detail on forming SIP URIs from tel
         URLs. As with a 3xx response, if a proxy "recurses" on the 416 by
         trying a SIP or SIPS URI instead, the 416 response SHOULD NOT
         be added to the response context. 5.
