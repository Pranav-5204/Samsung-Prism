URIs MUST NOT contain unescaped space and control
      characters. For each component, the set of valid BNF expansions defines exactly
   which characters may appear unescaped. All other characters MUST be
   escaped. For example, "@" is not in the set of characters in the user
   component, so the user "j@s0n" must have at least the @ sign encoded,
   as in "j%40s0n". Expanding the hname and hvalue tokens in Section 25 show that all URI
   reserved characters in header field names and values MUST be escaped. The telephone-subscriber subset of the user component has special
   escaping considerations. The set of characters not reserved in the
   RFC 2806 [9] description of telephone-subscriber contains a number of
   characters in various syntax elements that need to be escaped when
   used in SIP URIs. Any characters occurring in a telephone-subscriber
   that do not appear in an expansion of the BNF for the user rule MUST
   be escaped.
