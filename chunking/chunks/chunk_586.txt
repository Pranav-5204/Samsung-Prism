o  RFC 2543 was silent on whether a UA could initiate a new
      transaction to a peer while another was in progress. That is now
      specified here. It is allowed for non-INVITE requests, disallowed
      for INVITE. o  PGP was removed. It was not sufficiently specified, and not
      compatible with the more complete PGP MIME. It was replaced with
      S/MIME. o  Added the "sips" URI scheme for end-to-end TLS. This scheme is
      not backwards compatible with RFC 2543. Existing elements that
      receive a request with a SIPS URI scheme in the Request-URI will
      likely reject the request. This is actually a feature; it ensures
      that a call to a SIPS URI is only delivered if all path hops can
      be secured. o  Additional security features were added with TLS, and these are
      described in a much larger and complete security considerations
      section. o  In RFC 2543, a proxy was not required to forward provisional
      responses from 101 to 199 upstream.
