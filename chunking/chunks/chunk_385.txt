   [H14.3]. The semantics in SIP are identical to those defined in
   [H14.3]. An empty Accept-Encoding header field is permissible. It is
   equivalent to Accept-Encoding: identity, that is, only the identity
   encoding, meaning no encoding, is permissible. If no Accept-Encoding header field is present, the server SHOULD
   assume a default value of identity. This differs slightly from the HTTP definition, which indicates that
   when not present, any encoding can be used, but the identity encoding
   is preferred. Example:
      Accept-Encoding: gzip
20.3 Accept-Language
   The Accept-Language header field is used in requests to indicate the
   preferred languages for reason phrases, session descriptions, or
   status responses carried as message bodies in the response. If no
   Accept-Language header field is present, the server SHOULD assume all
   languages are acceptable to the client. The Accept-Language header field follows the syntax defined in
   [H14.4].
