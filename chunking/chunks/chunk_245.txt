This implies that the proxy will compute its own branch
         parameter, which will be globally unique for that branch, and
         contain the requisite magic cookie. Note that this implies that
         the branch parameter will be different for different instances
         of a spiraled or looped request through a proxy. Proxies choosing to detect loops have an additional constraint
         in the value they use for construction of the branch parameter. A proxy choosing to detect loops SHOULD create a branch
         parameter separable into two parts by the implementation. The
         first part MUST satisfy the constraints of Section 8.1.1.7 as
         described above. The second is used to perform loop detection
         and distinguish loops from spirals. Loop detection is performed by verifying that, when a request
         returns to a proxy, those fields having an impact on the
         processing of the request have not changed.
