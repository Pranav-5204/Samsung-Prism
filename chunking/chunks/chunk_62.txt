This may be useful when messages would otherwise
   become too large to be carried on the transport available to it
   (exceeding the maximum transmission unit (MTU) when using UDP, for
   example). These compact forms are defined in Section 20. A compact
   form MAY be substituted for the longer form of a header field name at
   any time without changing the semantics of the message. A header    field name MAY appear in both long and short forms within the same
   message. Implementations MUST accept both the long and short forms
   of each header name. 7.4 Bodies
   Requests, including new requests defined in extensions to this
   specification, MAY contain message bodies unless otherwise noted. The interpretation of the body depends on the request method. For response messages, the request method and the response status
   code determine the type and interpretation of any message body. All
   responses MAY include a body.
