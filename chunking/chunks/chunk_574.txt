The following information needs to be provided in an RFC publication
   in order to register a new header field name:
      o  The RFC number in which the header is registered;
      o  the name of the header field being registered;
      o  a compact form version for that header field, if one is
         defined;
   Some common and widely used header fields MAY be assigned one-letter
   compact forms (Section 7.3.3). Compact forms can only be assigned
   after SIP working group review, followed by RFC publication. 27.4 Method and Response Codes
   This specification establishes the Method and Response-Code sub-
   registries under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters and
   initiates their population as follows.
