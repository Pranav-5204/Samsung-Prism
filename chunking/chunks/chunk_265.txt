The rules above recommend that a proxy
         wishing to rewrite Record-Route header field values insert
         sufficiently distinct URIs into the Record-Route header field
         so that the right one may be selected for rewriting. A
         RECOMMENDED mechanism to achieve this is for the proxy to
         append a unique identifier for the proxy instance to the user
         portion of the URI. When the response arrives, the proxy modifies the first
         Record-Route whose identifier matches the proxy instance. The
         modification results in a URI without this piece of data
         appended to the user portion of the URI. Upon the next
         iteration, the same algorithm (find the topmost Record-Route
         header field value with the parameter) will correctly extract
         the next Record-Route header field value inserted by that
         proxy.
