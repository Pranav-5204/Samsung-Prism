The purpose of the URI is described by the "purpose"
   parameter. The "icon" parameter designates an image suitable as an
   iconic representation of the caller or callee. The "info" parameter
   describes the caller or callee in general, for example, through a web
   page. The "card" parameter provides a business card, for example, in
   vCard [36] or LDIF [37] formats. Additional tokens can be registered
   using IANA and the procedures in Section 27. Use of the Call-Info header field can pose a security risk. If a
   callee fetches the URIs provided by a malicious caller, the callee
   may be at risk for displaying inappropriate or offensive content,
   dangerous or illegal content, and so on. Therefore, it is
   RECOMMENDED that a UA only render the information in the Call-Info
   header field if it can verify the authenticity of the element that
   originated the header field and trusts that element. This need not
   be the peer UA; a proxy can insert this header field into requests.
