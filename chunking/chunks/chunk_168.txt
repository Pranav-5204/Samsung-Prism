A UAC SHOULD include a Contact header field in any target refresh
   requests within a dialog, and unless there is a need to change it,
   the URI SHOULD be the same as used in previous requests within the
   dialog. If the "secure" flag is true, that URI MUST be a SIPS URI. As discussed in Section 12.2.2, a Contact header field in a target
   refresh request updates the remote target URI. This allows a UA to
   provide a new contact address, should its address change during the
   duration of the dialog. However, requests that are not target refresh requests do not affect
   the remote target URI for the dialog. The rest of the request is formed as described in Section 8.1.1. Once the request has been constructed, the address of the server is
   computed and the request is sent, using the same procedures for
   requests outside of a dialog (Section 8.1.2).
