T1 is an estimate of the round-trip time (RTT), and
   it defaults to 500 ms.  Nearly all of the transaction timers
   described here scale with T1, and changing T1 adjusts their values. The request is not retransmitted over reliable transports. After
   receiving a 1xx response, any retransmissions cease altogether, and
   the client waits for further responses. The server transaction can
   send additional 1xx responses, which are not transmitted reliably by
   the server transaction. Eventually, the server transaction decides
   to send a final response. For unreliable transports, that response
   is retransmitted periodically, and for reliable transports, it is
   sent once. For each final response that is received at the client
   transaction, the client transaction sends an ACK, the purpose of
   which is to quench retransmissions of the response. 17.1.1.2 Formal Description
   The state machine for the INVITE client transaction is shown in
   Figure 5.
