If the configuration state is not time-invariant
         (for example, if a routing table is updated) any requests that
         could be affected by the change may not be forwarded
         statelessly during an interval equal to the transaction timeout
         window before or after the change. The method of processing
         the affected requests in that interval is an implementation
         decision. A common solution is to forward them transaction
         statefully. Stateless proxies MUST NOT perform special processing for CANCEL
   requests. They are processed by the above rules as any other
   requests. In particular, a stateless proxy applies the same Route
   header field processing to CANCEL requests that it applies to any
   other request. Response processing as described in Section 16.7 does not apply to a
   proxy behaving statelessly. When a response arrives at a stateless
   proxy, the proxy MUST inspect the sent-by value in the first
   (topmost) Via header field value.
