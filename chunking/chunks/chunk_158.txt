This state MUST be
   maintained for the duration of the dialog. If the request arrived over TLS, and the Request-URI contained a SIPS
   URI, the "secure" flag is set to TRUE. The route set MUST be set to the list of URIs in the Record-Route
   header field from the request, taken in order and preserving all URI
   parameters. If no Record-Route header field is present in the
   request, the route set MUST be set to the empty set. This route set,
   even if empty, overrides any pre-existing route set for future
   requests in this dialog. The remote target MUST be set to the URI
   from the Contact header field of the request. The remote sequence number MUST be set to the value of the sequence
   number in the CSeq header field of the request. The local sequence
   number MUST be empty. The call identifier component of the dialog ID
   MUST be set to the value of the Call-ID in the request.
