8.1.1.4 Call-ID
   The Call-ID header field acts as a unique identifier to group
   together a series of messages. It MUST be the same for all requests
   and responses sent by either UA in a dialog. It SHOULD be the same
   in each registration from a UA. In a new request created by a UAC outside of any dialog, the Call-ID
   header field MUST be selected by the UAC as a globally unique
   identifier over space and time unless overridden by method-specific
   behavior. All SIP UAs must have a means to guarantee that the Call-
   ID header fields they produce will not be inadvertently generated by
   any other UA.
