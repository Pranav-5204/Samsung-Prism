o  If the initial offer is in the first reliable non-failure
         message from the UAS back to UAC, the answer MUST be in the
         acknowledgement for that message (in this specification, ACK
         for a 2xx response). o  After having sent or received an answer to the first offer, the
         UAC MAY generate subsequent offers in requests based on rules
         specified for that method, but only if it has received answers
         to any previous offers, and has not sent any offers to which it
         hasnâ€™t gotten an answer. o  Once the UAS has sent or received an answer to the initial
         offer, it MUST NOT generate subsequent offers in any responses
         to the initial INVITE. This means that a UAS based on this
         specification alone can never generate subsequent offers until
         completion of the initial transaction.
