It would certainly be more difficult for the man-in-
   the-middle to emulate the voices of the participants than their
   signaling (a practice that was used with the Clipper chip-based
   secure telephone). The S/MIME mechanism allows UAs to send encrypted requests without
   preamble if they possess a certificate for the destination address-
   of-record on their keyring. However, it is possible that any
   particular device registered for an address-of-record will not hold
   the certificate that has been previously employed by the deviceâ€™s
   current user, and that it will therefore be unable to process an    encrypted request properly, which could lead to some avoidable error
   signaling. This is especially likely when an encrypted request is
   forked. The keys associated with S/MIME are most useful when associated with
   a particular user (an address-of-record) rather than a device (a UA).
