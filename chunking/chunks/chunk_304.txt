When in either the "Calling" or "Proceeding" states, reception of a
   2xx response MUST cause the client transaction to enter the
   "Terminated" state, and the response MUST be passed up to the TU. The handling of this response depends on whether the TU is a proxy    core or a UAC core. A UAC core will handle generation of the ACK for
   this response, while a proxy core will always forward the 200 (OK)
   upstream. The differing treatment of 200 (OK) between proxy and UAC
   is the reason that handling of it does not take place in the
   transaction layer. The client transaction MUST be destroyed the instant it enters the
   "Terminated" state. This is actually necessary to guarantee correct
   operation. The reason is that 2xx responses to an INVITE are treated
   differently; each one is forwarded by proxies, and the ACK handling
   in a UAC is different. Thus, each 2xx needs to be passed to a proxy
   core (so that it can be forwarded) and to a UAC core (so it can be
   acknowledged).
