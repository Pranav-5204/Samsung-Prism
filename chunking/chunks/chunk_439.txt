21.5.2 501 Not Implemented
   The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
   request. This is the appropriate response when a UAS does not
   recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for
   any user. (Proxies forward all requests regardless of method.) Note that a 405 (Method Not Allowed) is sent when the server
   recognizes the request method, but that method is not allowed or
   supported. 21.5.3 502 Bad Gateway
   The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
   response from the downstream server it accessed in attempting to
   fulfill the request. 21.5.4 503 Service Unavailable
   The server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
   temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The server MAY
   indicate when the client should retry the request in a Retry-After
   header field. If no Retry-After is given, the client MUST act as if
   it had received a 500 (Server Internal Error) response.
