The compact form of the Supported header field is k.
   Example:
      Supported: 100rel
20.38 Timestamp
   The Timestamp header field describes when the UAC sent the request to
   the UAS. See Section 8.2.6 for details on how to generate a response to a
   request that contains the header field. Although there is no
   normative behavior defined here that makes use of the header, it
   allows for extensions or SIP applications to obtain RTT estimates. Example:
      Timestamp: 54
20.39 To
   The To header field specifies the logical recipient of the request. The optional "display-name" is meant to be rendered by a human-user
   interface. The "tag" parameter serves as a general mechanism for
   dialog identification. See Section 19.3 for details of the "tag" parameter. Comparison of To header fields for equality is identical to
   comparison of From header fields. See Section 20.10 for the rules
   for parsing a display name, URI and URI parameters, and header field
   parameters.
