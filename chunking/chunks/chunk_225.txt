This may consist of obtaining information from a location service
   created by a SIP Registrar, reading a database, consulting a presence
   server, utilizing other protocols, or simply performing an
   algorithmic substitution on the Request-URI. When accessing the
   location service constructed by a registrar, the Request-URI MUST
   first be canonicalized as described in Section 10.3 before being used
   as an index. The output of these mechanisms is used to construct the
   target set. If the Request-URI does not provide sufficient information for the
   proxy to determine the target set, it SHOULD return a 485 (Ambiguous)
   response. This response SHOULD contain a Contact header field
   containing URIs of new addresses to be tried. For example, an INVITE    to sip:John.Smith@company.com may be ambiguous at a proxy whose
   location service has multiple John Smiths listed. See Section
   21.4.23 for details.
