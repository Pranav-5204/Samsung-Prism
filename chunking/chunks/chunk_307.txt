Therefore, placement of bodies in ACK for non-2xx is NOT RECOMMENDED,
   but if done, the body types are restricted to any that appeared in
   the INVITE, assuming that the response to the INVITE was not 415. If
   it was, the body in the ACK MAY be any type listed in the Accept
   header field in the 415.
