This threat belongs to a family of threats that rely on the absence
   of cryptographic assurance of a request’s originator. Any SIP UAS
   that represents a valuable service (a gateway that interworks SIP
   requests with traditional telephone calls, for example) might want to
   control access to its resources by authenticating requests that it
   receives. Even end-user UAs, for example SIP phones, have an
   interest in ascertaining the identities of originators of requests. This threat demonstrates the need for security services that enable
   SIP entities to authenticate the originators of requests. 26.1.2 Impersonating a Server
   The domain to which a request is destined is generally specified in
   the Request-URI. UAs commonly contact a server in this domain
   directly in order to deliver a request. However, there is always a
   possibility that an attacker could impersonate the remote server, and
   that the UA’s request could be intercepted by some other party.
