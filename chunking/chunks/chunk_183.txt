If the Content-Disposition header field is missing, bodies of
   Content-Type application/sdp imply the disposition "session", while
   other content types imply "render". Once the INVITE has been created, the UAC follows the procedures
   defined for sending requests outside of a dialog (Section 8). This
   results in the construction of a client transaction that will
   ultimately send the request and deliver responses to the UAC. 13.2.2 Processing INVITE Responses
   Once the INVITE has been passed to the INVITE client transaction, the
   UAC waits for responses for the INVITE. If the INVITE client
   transaction returns a timeout rather than a response the TU acts as
   if a 408 (Request Timeout) response had been received, as described
   in Section 8.1.3. 13.2.2.1 1xx Responses
   Zero, one or multiple provisional responses may arrive before one or
   more final responses are received. Provisional responses for an
   INVITE request can create "early dialogs".
