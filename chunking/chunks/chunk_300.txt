However, the client transaction does not know the
   value of T1 in use by the server transaction, so an absolute minimum
   of 32s is used instead of basing Timer D on T1. Any retransmissions of the final response that are received while in
   the "Completed" state MUST cause the ACK to be re-passed to the
   transport layer for retransmission, but the newly received response
   MUST NOT be passed up to the TU. A retransmission of the response is
   defined as any response which would match the same client transaction
   based on the rules of Section 17.1.3. |INVITE from TU
