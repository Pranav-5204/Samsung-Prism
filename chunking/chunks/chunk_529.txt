26.2 Security Mechanisms
   From the threats described above, we gather that the fundamental
   security services required for the SIP protocol are: preserving the
   confidentiality and integrity of messaging, preventing replay attacks
   or message spoofing, providing for the authentication and privacy of
   the participants in a session, and preventing denial-of-service
   attacks. Bodies within SIP messages separately require the security
   services of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Rather than defining new security mechanisms specific to SIP, SIP
   reuses wherever possible existing security models derived from the
   HTTP and SMTP space. Full encryption of messages provides the best means to preserve the
   confidentiality of signaling - it can also guarantee that messages
   are not modified by any malicious intermediaries.
