7.4.2 Message Body Length
   The body length in bytes is provided by the Content-Length header
   field. Section 20.14 describes the necessary contents of this header
   field in detail. The "chunked" transfer encoding of HTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used for SIP. (Note: The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order
   to transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size
   indicator.) 7.5 Framing SIP Messages
   Unlike HTTP, SIP implementations can use UDP or other unreliable
   datagram protocols. Each such datagram carries one request or
   response. See Section 18 on constraints on usage of unreliable
   transports. Implementations processing SIP messages over stream-oriented
   transports MUST ignore any CRLF appearing before the start-line
   [H4.1]. The Content-Length header field value is used to locate the end of
      each SIP message in a stream. It will always be present when SIP
      messages are sent over stream-oriented transports.
