This section describes how to modify the actual
   session. This modification can involve changing addresses or ports,
   adding a media stream, deleting a media stream, and so on. This is
   accomplished by sending a new INVITE request within the same dialog
   that established the session. An INVITE request sent within an
   existing dialog is known as a re-INVITE. Note that a single re-INVITE can modify the dialog and the
      parameters of the session at the same time. Either the caller or callee can modify an existing session. The behavior of a UA on detection of media failure is a matter of
   local policy. However, automated generation of re-INVITE or BYE is
   NOT RECOMMENDED to avoid flooding the network with traffic when there
   is congestion. In any case, if these messages are sent
   automatically, they SHOULD be sent after some randomized interval. Note that the paragraph above refers to automatically generated
      BYEs and re-INVITEs.
