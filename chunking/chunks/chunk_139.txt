A registrar has to know (for example, through configuration) the set
   of domain(s) for which it maintains bindings. REGISTER requests MUST
   be processed by a registrar in the order that they are received. REGISTER requests MUST also be processed atomically, meaning that a
   particular REGISTER request is either processed completely or not at
   all. Each REGISTER message MUST be processed independently of any
   other registration or binding changes. When receiving a REGISTER request, a registrar follows these steps:
      1. The registrar inspects the Request-URI to determine whether it
         has access to bindings for the domain identified in the
         Request-URI. If not, and if the server also acts as a proxy
         server, the server SHOULD forward the request to the addressed
         domain, following the general behavior for proxying messages
         described in Section 16. 2.
