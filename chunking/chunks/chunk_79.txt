These
   7 characters are used as a magic cookie (7 is deemed sufficient to
   ensure that an older RFC 2543 implementation would not pick such a
   value), so that servers receiving the request can determine that the
   branch ID was constructed in the fashion described by this    specification (that is, globally unique). Beyond this requirement,
   the precise format of the branch token is implementation-defined. The Via header maddr, ttl, and sent-by components will be set when
   the request is processed by the transport layer (Section 18). Via processing for proxies is described in Section 16.6 Item 8 and
   Section 16.7 Item 3. 8.1.1.8 Contact
   The Contact header field provides a SIP or SIPS URI that can be used
   to contact that specific instance of the UA for subsequent requests. The Contact header field MUST be present and contain exactly one SIP
   or SIPS URI in any request that can result in the establishment of a
   dialog.
