This provides a simple alternative to a pre-existing route
   set as a way to specify an outbound proxy. However, that approach
   for configuring an outbound proxy is NOT RECOMMENDED; a pre-existing
   route set with a single URI SHOULD be used instead. If the request
   contains a Route header field, the request SHOULD be sent to the
   locations derived from its topmost value, but MAY be sent to any
   server that the UA is certain will honor the Route and Request-URI
   policies specified in this document (as opposed to those in RFC
   2543). In particular, a UAC configured with an outbound proxy SHOULD    attempt to send the request to the location indicated in the first
   Route header field value instead of adopting the policy of sending
   all messages to the outbound proxy. This ensures that outbound proxies that do not add Record-Route
      header field values will drop out of the path of subsequent
      requests.
