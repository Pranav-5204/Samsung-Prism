The "warn-text" should be in a natural language that is most likely
   to be intelligible to the human user receiving the response. This
   decision can be based on any available knowledge, such as the
   location of the user, the Accept-Language field in a request, or the    Content-Language field in a response. The default language is i-
   default [21]. The currently-defined "warn-code"s are listed below, with a
   recommended warn-text in English and a description of their meaning. These warnings describe failures induced by the session description. The first digit of warning codes beginning with "3" indicates
   warnings specific to SIP.
