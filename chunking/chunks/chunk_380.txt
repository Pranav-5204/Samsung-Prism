Values in this column are:
      R: header field may only appear in requests;
      r: header field may only appear in responses;
      2xx, 4xx, etc. : A numerical value or range indicates response
           codes with which the header field can be used;
      c: header field is copied from the request to the response. An empty entry in the "where" column indicates that the header
           field may be present in all requests and responses. The "proxy" column describes the operations a proxy may perform on a
   header field:
      a: A proxy can add or concatenate the header field if not present. m: A proxy can modify an existing header field value. d: A proxy can delete a header field value. r: A proxy must be able to read the header field, and thus this
           header field cannot be encrypted. The next six columns relate to the presence of a header field in a
   method:
      c: Conditional; requirements on the header field depend on the
           context of the message.
