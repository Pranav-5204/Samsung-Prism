Before they forward the request, both proxy servers SHOULD add a
   Record-Route header field to the request so that all future requests
   in this dialog will pass through the proxy servers. The proxy
   servers can thereby continue to provide security services for the
   lifetime of this dialog. If the proxy servers do not add themselves
   to the Record-Route, future messages will pass directly end-to-end
   between Alice and Bob without any security services (unless the two
   parties agree on some independent end-to-end security such as
   S/MIME). In this respect the SIP trapezoid model can provide a nice
   structure where conventions of agreement between the site proxies can
   provide a reasonably secure channel between Alice and Bob.
