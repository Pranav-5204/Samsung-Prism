The new URI provided by the proxy MUST satisfy the same
         constraints on URIs placed in Record-Route header fields in
         requests (see Step 4 of Section 16.6) with the following
         modifications:
         The URI SHOULD NOT contain the transport parameter unless the
         proxy has knowledge that the next upstream (as opposed to
         downstream) element that will be in the path of subsequent
         requests supports that transport. When a proxy does decide to modify the Record-Route header
         field in the response, one of the operations it performs is
         locating the Record-Route value that it had inserted. If the
         request spiraled, and the proxy inserted a Record-Route value
         in each iteration of the spiral, locating the correct value in
         the response (which must be the proper iteration in the reverse
         direction) is tricky.
