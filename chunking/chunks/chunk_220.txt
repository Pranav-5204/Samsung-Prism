If the parameters match, the
      request has looped. If they differ, the request is spiraling, and
      processing continues. If a loop is detected, the element MAY
      return a 482 (Loop Detected) response. 5. Proxy-Require check
      Future extensions to this protocol may introduce features that
      require special handling by proxies. Endpoints will include a
      Proxy-Require header field in requests that use these features,
      telling the proxy not to process the request unless the feature is
      understood. If the request contains a Proxy-Require header field (Section
      20.29) with one or more option-tags this element does not
      understand, the element MUST return a 420 (Bad Extension)
      response. The response MUST include an Unsupported (Section
      20.40) header field listing those option-tags the element did not
      understand. 6.
