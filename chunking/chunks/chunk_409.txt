Example:
      Record-Route: <sip:server10.biloxi.com;lr>,
                    <sip:bigbox3.site3.atlanta.com;lr>
20.31 Reply-To
   The Reply-To header field contains a logical return URI that may be
   different from the From header field. For example, the URI MAY be
   used to return missed calls or unestablished sessions. If the user
   wished to remain anonymous, the header field SHOULD either be omitted
   from the request or populated in such a way that does not reveal any
   private information. Even if the "display-name" is empty, the "name-addr" form MUST be
   used if the "addr-spec" contains a comma, question mark, or
   semicolon. Syntax issues are discussed in Section 7.3.1. Example:
      Reply-To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>
20.32 Require
   The Require header field is used by UACs to tell UASs about options
   that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to process the
   request. Although an optional header field, the Require MUST NOT be
   ignored if it is present.
