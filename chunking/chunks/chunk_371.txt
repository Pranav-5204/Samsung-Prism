URIs from business cards, web pages, and even from
   sources inside the protocol such as registered contacts may contain
   inappropriate header fields or body parts. An implementation MUST include any provided transport, maddr, ttl, or
   user parameter in the Request-URI of the formed request. If the URI
   contains a method parameter, its value MUST be used as the method of
   the request. The method parameter MUST NOT be placed in the
   Request-URI. Unknown URI parameters MUST be placed in the messageâ€™s
   Request-URI. An implementation SHOULD treat the presence of any headers or body
   parts in the URI as a desire to include them in the message, and
   choose to honor the request on a per-component basis. An implementation SHOULD NOT honor these obviously dangerous header
   fields: From, Call-ID, CSeq, Via, and Record-Route. An implementation SHOULD NOT honor any requested Route header field
   values in order to not be used as an unwitting agent in malicious
   attacks.
