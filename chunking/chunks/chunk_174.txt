The UAS will never see the first
      request, and thus, it will notice a gap in the CSeq number space. Such a gap does not represent any error condition. When a UAS receives a target refresh request, it MUST replace the
   dialogâ€™s remote target URI with the URI from the Contact header field
   in that request, if present. 12.3 Termination of a Dialog
   Independent of the method, if a request outside of a dialog generates
   a non-2xx final response, any early dialogs created through
   provisional responses to that request are terminated. The mechanism
   for terminating confirmed dialogs is method specific. In this
   specification, the BYE method terminates a session and the dialog
   associated with it. See Section 15 for details. 13 Initiating a Session
13.1 Overview
   When a user agent client desires to initiate a session (for example,
   audio, video, or a game), it formulates an INVITE request. The
   INVITE request asks a server to establish a session.
