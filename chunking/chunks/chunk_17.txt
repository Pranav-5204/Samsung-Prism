When Alice’s softphone receives the 180 (Ringing) response, it passes
   this information to Alice, perhaps using an audio ringback tone or by
   displaying a message on Alice’s screen. In this example, Bob decides to answer the call. When he picks up
   the handset, his SIP phone sends a 200 (OK) response to indicate that
   the call has been answered. The 200 (OK) contains a message body
   with the SDP media description of the type of session that Bob is
   willing to establish with Alice. As a result, there is a two-phase
   exchange of SDP messages: Alice sent one to Bob, and Bob sent one
   back to Alice. This two-phase exchange provides basic negotiation
   capabilities and is based on a simple offer/answer model of SDP
   exchange. If Bob did not wish to answer the call or was busy on
   another call, an error response would have been sent instead of the
   200 (OK), which would have resulted in no media session being
   established.
