17.1 Client Transaction
   The client transaction provides its functionality through the
   maintenance of a state machine. The TU communicates with the client transaction through a simple
   interface. When the TU wishes to initiate a new transaction, it
   creates a client transaction and passes it the SIP request to send
   and an IP address, port, and transport to which to send it. The
   client transaction begins execution of its state machine. Valid
   responses are passed up to the TU from the client transaction. There are two types of client transaction state machines, depending
   on the method of the request passed by the TU. One handles client
   transactions for INVITE requests. This type of machine is referred
   to as an INVITE client transaction. Another type handles client
   transactions for all requests except INVITE and ACK. This is
   referred to as a non-INVITE client transaction. There is no client
   transaction for ACK.
