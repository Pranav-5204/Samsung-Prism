When timer A fires 2*T1 seconds later, the request MUST be
   retransmitted again (assuming the client transaction is still in this
   state). This process MUST continue so that the request is
   retransmitted with intervals that double after each transmission. These retransmissions SHOULD only be done while the client
   transaction is in the "calling" state. The default value for T1 is 500 ms.  T1 is an estimate of the RTT
   between the client and server transactions. Elements MAY (though it
   is NOT RECOMMENDED) use smaller values of T1 within closed, private
   networks that do not permit general Internet connection. T1 MAY be
   chosen larger, and this is RECOMMENDED if it is known in advance
   (such as on high latency access links) that the RTT is larger. Whatever the value of T1, the exponential backoffs on retransmissions
   described in this section MUST be used.
