Note
   that some response codes (detailed in 8.1.3.5) indicate that the
   request can be retried; requests that are reattempted should not be
   considered failures. When a failure for a particular contact address is received, the
   client SHOULD try the next contact address. This will involve
   creating a new client transaction to deliver a new request. In order to create a request based on a contact address in a 3xx
   response, a UAC MUST copy the entire URI from the target set into the
   Request-URI, except for the "method-param" and "header" URI
   parameters (see Section 19.1.1 for a definition of these parameters). It uses the "header" parameters to create header field values for the
   new request, overwriting header field values associated with the
   redirected request in accordance with the guidelines in Section
   19.1.5.
