Even if the "display-name" is empty, the "name-addr" form MUST be
   used if the "addr-spec" contains a comma, semicolon, or question
   mark. There may or may not be LWS between the display-name and the
   "<". These rules for parsing a display name, URI and URI parameters, and
   header parameters also apply for the header fields To and From. The Contact header field has a role similar to the Location header
      field in HTTP. However, the HTTP header field only allows one
      address, unquoted. Since URIs can contain commas and semicolons
      as reserved characters, they can be mistaken for header or
      parameter delimiters, respectively. The compact form of the Contact header field is m (for "moved").
