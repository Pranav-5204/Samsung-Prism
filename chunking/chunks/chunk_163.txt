Other extensions may define different target refresh
   requests for dialogs established in other ways. Note that an ACK is NOT a target refresh request. Target refresh requests only update the dialogâ€™s remote target URI,
   and not the route set formed from the Record-Route. Updating the
   latter would introduce severe backwards compatibility problems with
   RFC 2543-compliant systems. 12.2.1 UAC Behavior
12.2.1.1 Generating the Request
   A request within a dialog is constructed by using many of the
   components of the state stored as part of the dialog. The URI in the To field of the request MUST be set to the remote URI
   from the dialog state. The tag in the To header field of the request
   MUST be set to the remote tag of the dialog ID. The From URI of the
   request MUST be set to the local URI from the dialog state. The tag
   in the From header field of the request MUST be set to the local tag
   of the dialog ID.
