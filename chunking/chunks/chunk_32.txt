The procedures of Sections 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 deal
   entirely with the UA core (Section 9 describes cancellation, which
   applies to both UA core and proxy core). Section 16 discusses the
   proxy element, which facilitates routing of messages between user
   agents. 6 Definitions
   The following terms have special significance for SIP. Address-of-Record: An address-of-record (AOR) is a SIP or SIPS URI
         that points to a domain with a location service that can map
         the URI to another URI where the user might be available. Typically, the location service is populated through
         registrations. An AOR is frequently thought of as the "public
         address" of the user. Back-to-Back User Agent: A back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) is a
         logical entity that receives a request and processes it as a
         user agent server (UAS).
