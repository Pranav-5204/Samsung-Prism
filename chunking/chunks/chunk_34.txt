Clients may or may not interact
         directly with a human user. User agent clients and proxies are
         clients. Conference: A multimedia session (see below) that contains
         multiple participants. Core: Core designates the functions specific to a particular type
         of SIP entity, i.e., specific to either a stateful or stateless
         proxy, a user agent or registrar. All cores, except those for
         the stateless proxy, are transaction users. Dialog: A dialog is a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two
         UAs that persists for some time. A dialog is established by
         SIP messages, such as a 2xx response to an INVITE request. A
         dialog is identified by a call identifier, local tag, and a
         remote tag. A dialog was formerly known as a call leg in RFC
         2543.
