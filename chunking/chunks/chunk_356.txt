When an maddr parameter is present, the port
         and transport components of the URI apply to the address
         indicated in the maddr parameter value. [4] describes the
         proper interpretation of the transport, maddr, and hostport in
         order to obtain the destination address, port, and transport
         for sending a request. The maddr field has been used as a simple form of loose source
         routing. It allows a URI to specify a proxy that must be
         traversed en-route to the destination. Continuing to use the
         maddr parameter this way is strongly discouraged (the
         mechanisms that enable it are deprecated). Implementations
         should instead use the Route mechanism described in this
         document, establishing a pre-existing route set if necessary
         (see Section 8.1.1.1). This provides a full URI to describe
         the node to be traversed.
