Typically, this
         means that the request’s Request-URI differs from its previous
         arrival. A spiral is not an error condition, unlike a loop. A
         typical cause for this is call forwarding. A user calls
         joe@example.com. The example.com proxy forwards it to Joe’s
         PC, which in turn, forwards it to bob@example.com. This
         request is proxied back to the example.com proxy. However,
         this is not a loop. Since the request is targeted at a
         different user, it is considered a spiral, and is a valid
         condition. Stateful Proxy: A logical entity that maintains the client and
         server transaction state machines defined by this specification
         during the processing of a request, also known as a transaction
         stateful proxy. The behavior of a stateful proxy is further
         defined in Section 16. A (transaction) stateful proxy is not
         the same as a call stateful proxy.
