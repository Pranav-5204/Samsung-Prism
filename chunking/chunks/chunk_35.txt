Downstream: A direction of message forwarding within a transaction
         that refers to the direction that requests flow from the user
         agent client to user agent server. Final Response: A response that terminates a SIP transaction, as
         opposed to a provisional response that does not. All 2xx, 3xx,
         4xx, 5xx and 6xx responses are final. Header: A header is a component of a SIP message that conveys
         information about the message. It is structured as a sequence
         of header fields. Header Field: A header field is a component of the SIP message
         header. A header field can appear as one or more header field
         rows. Header field rows consist of a header field name and zero
         or more header field values. Multiple header field values on a          given header field row are separated by commas. Some header
         fields can only have a single header field value, and as a
         result, always appear as a single header field row.
