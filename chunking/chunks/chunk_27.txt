When we say that an element "contains" a layer, we mean
   it is compliant to the set of rules defined by that layer. Not every element specified by the protocol contains every layer. Furthermore, the elements specified by SIP are logical elements, not
   physical ones. A physical realization can choose to act as different
   logical elements, perhaps even on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The lowest layer of SIP is its syntax and encoding. Its encoding is
   specified using an augmented Backus-Naur Form grammar (BNF). The
   complete BNF is specified in Section 25; an overview of a SIP
   messageâ€™s structure can be found in Section 7. The second layer is the transport layer. It defines how a client
   sends requests and receives responses and how a server receives
   requests and sends responses over the network. All SIP elements
   contain a transport layer. The transport layer is described in
   Section 18. The third layer is the transaction layer.
