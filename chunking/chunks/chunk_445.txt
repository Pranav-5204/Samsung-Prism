This is a change from RFC 2543. 22.1 Framework
   The framework for SIP authentication closely parallels that of HTTP
   (RFC 2617 [17]). In particular, the BNF for auth-scheme, auth-param,
   challenge, realm, realm-value, and credentials is identical (although
   the usage of "Basic" as a scheme is not permitted). In SIP, a UAS
   uses the 401 (Unauthorized) response to challenge the identity of a
   UAC. Additionally, registrars and redirect servers MAY make use of
   401 (Unauthorized) responses for authentication, but proxies MUST
   NOT, and instead MAY use the 407 (Proxy Authentication Required)
   response. The requirements for inclusion of the Proxy-Authenticate,
   Proxy-Authorization, WWW-Authenticate, and Authorization in the
   various messages are identical to those described in RFC 2617 [17]. Since SIP does not have the concept of a canonical root URL, the
   notion of protection spaces is interpreted differently in SIP. The
   realm string alone defines the protection domain.
