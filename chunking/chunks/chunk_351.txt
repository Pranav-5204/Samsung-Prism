Examples of communications resources include the following:
      o  a user of an online service
      o  an appearance on a multi-line phone
      o  a mailbox on a messaging system
      o  a PSTN number at a gateway service
      o  a group (such as "sales" or "helpdesk") in an organization
   A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted securely. This
   means, in particular, that TLS is to be used between the UAC and the
   domain that owns the URI. From there, secure communications are used
   to reach the user, where the specific security mechanism depends on
   the policy of the domain. Any resource described by a SIP URI can be
   "upgraded" to a SIPS URI by just changing the scheme, if it is
   desired to communicate with that resource securely. 19.1.1 SIP and SIPS URI Components
   The "sip:" and "sips:" schemes follow the guidelines in RFC 2396 [5].
