Tags are helpful in
   fault tolerant systems, where a dialog is to be recovered on an
   alternate server after a failure. A UAS can select the tag in such a
   way that a backup can recognize a request as part of a dialog on the
   failed server, and therefore determine that it should attempt to
   recover the dialog and any other state associated with it. 20 Header Fields
   The general syntax for header fields is covered in Section 7.3. This
   section lists the full set of header fields along with notes on
   syntax, meaning, and usage. Throughout this section, we use [HX.Y]
   to refer to Section X.Y of the current HTTP/1.1 specification RFC
   2616 [8]. Examples of each header field are given. Information about header fields in relation to methods and proxy
   processing is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The "where" column describes the request and response types in which
   the header field can be used.
