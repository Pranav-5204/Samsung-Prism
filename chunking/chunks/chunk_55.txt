However, the latter is
   specified in HTTP with implicit whitespace and folding. This
   specification conforms to RFC 2234 [10] and uses only explicit
   whitespace and folding as an integral part of the grammar. [H4.2] also specifies that multiple header fields of the same field
   name whose value is a comma-separated list can be combined into one
   header field. That applies to SIP as well, but the specific rule is
   different because of the different grammars. Specifically, any SIP
   header whose grammar is of the form
      header  =  "header-name" HCOLON header-value *(COMMA header-value)
   allows for combining header fields of the same name into a comma-
   separated list. The Contact header field allows a comma-separated
   list unless the header field value is "*". 7.3.1 Header Field Format
   Header fields follow the same generic header format as that given in
   Section 2.2 of RFC 2822 [3].
