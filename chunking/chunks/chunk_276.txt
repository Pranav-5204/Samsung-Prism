In particular, if the proxy inserts a Record-Route
         value or pushes URIs into the Route header field, it MUST place
         the same values in retransmissions of the request. As for the
         Via branch parameter, this implies that the transformations
         MUST be based on time-invariant configuration or
         retransmission-invariant properties of the request. o  A stateless proxy determines where to forward the request as
         described for stateful proxies in Section 16.6 Item 10. The
         request is sent directly to the transport layer instead of
         through a client transaction. Since a stateless proxy must forward retransmitted requests to
         the same destination and add identical branch parameters to
         each of them, it can only use information from the message
         itself and time-invariant configuration data for those
         calculations.
