If a user or service chooses to be
   reachable at an address that is guessable from the personâ€™s name and
   organizational affiliation (which describes most addresses-of-
   record), the traditional method of ensuring privacy by having an
   unlisted "phone number" is compromised. A user location service can
   infringe on the privacy of the recipient of a session invitation by
   divulging their specific whereabouts to the caller; an implementation
   consequently SHOULD be able to restrict, on a per-user basis, what
   kind of location and availability information is given out to certain
   classes of callers. This is a whole class of problem that is
   expected to be studied further in ongoing SIP work. In some cases, users may want to conceal personal information in
   header fields that convey identity.
