For example,
      Contact: <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;expires=3600
   is equivalent to
      CONTACT: <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;ExPiReS=3600
   and
      Content-Disposition: session;handling=optional
   is equivalent to
      content-disposition: Session;HANDLING=OPTIONAL
   The following two header fields are not equivalent:
      Warning: 370 devnull "Choose a bigger pipe"
      Warning: 370 devnull "CHOOSE A BIGGER PIPE"
7.3.2 Header Field Classification
   Some header fields only make sense in requests or responses. These
   are called request header fields and response header fields,
   respectively. If a header field appears in a message not matching
   its category (such as a request header field in a response), it MUST
   be ignored. Section 20 defines the classification of each header
   field. 7.3.3 Compact Form
   SIP provides a mechanism to represent common header field names in an
   abbreviated form.
