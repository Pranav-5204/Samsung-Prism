It first performs the request processing procedures of Section 8.2,
   which are applied for both requests inside and outside of a dialog. Assuming these processing states are completed without generating a
   response, the UAS core performs the additional processing steps:
      1. If the request is an INVITE that contains an Expires header
         field, the UAS core sets a timer for the number of seconds
         indicated in the header field value. When the timer fires, the
         invitation is considered to be expired. If the invitation
         expires before the UAS has generated a final response, a 487
         (Request Terminated) response SHOULD be generated. 2. If the request is a mid-dialog request, the method-independent
         processing described in Section 12.2.2 is first applied. It
         might also modify the session; Section 14 provides details. 3.
