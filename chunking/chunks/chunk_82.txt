As with the Supported header field, the option tags in the Require
   and Proxy-Require header fields MUST only refer to extensions defined

   After a new request has been created, and the header fields described
   above have been properly constructed, any additional optional header

   be formulated to characterize the contents of the body. For further
   information on these header fields, see Sections 20.11 through 20.15. 8.1.2 Sending the Request
   The destination for the request is then computed. Unless there is
   local policy specifying otherwise, the destination MUST be determined
   by applying the DNS procedures described in [4] as follows.
