This is a change
   from RFC 2543, in which the Request-URI and the realm together
   defined the protection domain. This previous definition of protection domain caused some amount
      of confusion since the Request-URI sent by the UAC and the
      Request-URI received by the challenging server might be different,
      and indeed the final form of the Request-URI might not be known to
      the UAC. Also, the previous definition depended on the presence
      of a SIP URI in the Request-URI and seemed to rule out alternative
      URI schemes (for example, the tel URL). Operators of user agents or proxy servers that will authenticate
   received requests MUST adhere to the following guidelines for
   creation of a realm string for their server:
      o  Realm strings MUST be globally unique. It is RECOMMENDED that
         a realm string contain a hostname or domain name, following the
         recommendation in Section 3.2.1 of RFC 2617 [17].
