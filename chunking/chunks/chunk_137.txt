10.2.7 Transmitting a Request
   Once the REGISTER method has been constructed, and the destination of
   the message identified, UACs follow the procedures described in
   Section 8.1.2 to hand off the REGISTER to the transaction layer. If the transaction layer returns a timeout error because the REGISTER
   yielded no response, the UAC SHOULD NOT immediately re-attempt a
   registration to the same registrar. An immediate re-attempt is likely to also timeout. Waiting some
      reasonable time interval for the conditions causing the timeout to
      be corrected reduces unnecessary load on the network. No specific
      interval is mandated. 10.2.8 Error Responses
   If a UA receives a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response, it MAY retry
   the registration after making the expiration interval of all contact
   addresses in the REGISTER request equal to or greater than the
   expiration interval within the Min-Expires header field of the 423
   (Interval Too Brief) response.
