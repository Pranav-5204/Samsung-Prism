When a UAC sends a request that is within the context of a
   dialog, it follows the common UAC rules as discussed in Section 8 but
   also the rules for mid-dialog requests. Section 12 discusses dialogs
   and presents the procedures for their construction and maintenance,
   in addition to construction of requests within a dialog. The most important method in SIP is the INVITE method, which is used
   to establish a session between participants. A session is a
   collection of participants, and streams of media between them, for
   the purposes of communication. Section 13 discusses how sessions are
   initiated, resulting in one or more SIP dialogs. Section 14
   discusses how characteristics of that session are modified through
   the use of an INVITE request within a dialog. Finally, section 15
   discusses how a session is terminated.
