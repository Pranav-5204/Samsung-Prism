On a peer-to-peer level, UAs trust the network to authenticate one
   another ordinarily; however, S/MIME can also be used to provide
   direct authentication when the network does not, or if the network
   itself is not trusted. The following is an illustrative example in which these security
   mechanisms are used by various UAs and servers to prevent the sorts
   of threats described in Section 26.1. While implementers and network
   administrators MAY follow the normative guidelines given in the
   remainder of this section, these are provided only as example
   implementations. 26.3.2.1 Registration
   When a UA comes online and registers with its local administrative
   domain, it SHOULD establish a TLS connection with its registrar
   (Section 10 describes how the UA reaches its registrar).
