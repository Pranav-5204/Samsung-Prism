If
         the Call-ID value in the existing binding differs from the
         Call-ID value in the request, the binding MUST be removed if
         the expiration time is zero and updated otherwise. If they are
         the same, the registrar compares the CSeq value. If the value
         is higher than that of the existing binding, it MUST update or
         remove the binding as above. If not, the update MUST be
         aborted and the request fails. This algorithm ensures that out-of-order requests from the same
         UA are ignored. Each binding record records the Call-ID and CSeq values from
         the request. The binding updates MUST be committed (that is, made visible to
         the proxy or redirect server) if and only if all binding
         updates and additions succeed.
