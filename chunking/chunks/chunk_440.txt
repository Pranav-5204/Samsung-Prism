A client (proxy or UAC) receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD
   attempt to forward the request to an alternate server. It SHOULD NOT
   forward any other requests to that server for the duration specified
   in the Retry-After header field, if present. Servers MAY refuse the connection or drop the request instead of
   responding with 503 (Service Unavailable). 21.5.5 504 Server Time-out
   The server did not receive a timely response from an external server
   it accessed in attempting to process the request. 408 (Request
   Timeout) should be used instead if there was no response within the
   period specified in the Expires header field from the upstream
   server. 21.5.6 505 Version Not Supported
   The server does not support, or refuses to support, the SIP protocol
   version that was used in the request. The server is indicating that
   it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same
   major version as the client, other than with this error message.
