Registration creates bindings in a location service for a particular
   domain that associates an address-of-record URI with one or more
   contact addresses. Thus, when a proxy for that domain receives a
   request whose Request-URI matches the address-of-record, the proxy
   will forward the request to the contact addresses registered to that
   address-of-record. Generally, it only makes sense to register an
   address-of-record at a domainâ€™s location service when requests for
   that address-of-record would be routed to that domain. In most
   cases, this means that the domain of the registration will need to
   match the domain in the URI of the address-of-record. There are many ways by which the contents of the location service can
   be established. One way is administratively. In the above example,
   Bob is known to be a member of the engineering department through
   access to a corporate database. However, SIP provides a mechanism
   for a UA to create a binding explicitly.
