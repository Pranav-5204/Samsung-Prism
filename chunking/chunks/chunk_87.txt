A
   UAC MUST treat any provisional response different than 100 that it
   does not recognize as 183 (Session Progress). A UAC MUST be able to
   process 100 and 183 responses. 8.1.3.3 Vias
   If more than one Via header field value is present in a response, the
   UAC SHOULD discard the message. The presence of additional Via header field values that precede
      the originator of the request suggests that the message was
      misrouted or possibly corrupted. 8.1.3.4 Processing 3xx Responses
   Upon receipt of a redirection response (for example, a 301 response
   status code), clients SHOULD use the URI(s) in the Contact header
   field to formulate one or more new requests based on the redirected
   request. This process is similar to that of a proxy recursing on a
   3xx class response as detailed in Sections 16.5 and 16.6. A client
   starts with an initial target set containing exactly one URI, the
   Request-URI of the original request.
