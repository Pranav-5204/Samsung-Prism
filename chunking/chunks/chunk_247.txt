If a proxy wishes to detect loops, the "branch" parameter it
         supplies MUST depend on all information affecting processing of
         a request, including the incoming Request-URI and any header
         fields affecting the requestâ€™s admission or routing. This is
         necessary to distinguish looped requests from requests whose
         routing parameters have changed before returning to this
         server. The request method MUST NOT be included in the calculation of
         the branch parameter. In particular, CANCEL and ACK requests
         (for non-2xx responses) MUST have the same branch value as the
         corresponding request they cancel or acknowledge. The branch
         parameter is used in correlating those requests at the server
         handling them (see Sections 17.2.3 and 9.2). 9.
