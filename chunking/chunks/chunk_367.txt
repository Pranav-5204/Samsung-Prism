o  The ordering of parameters and header fields is not significant
         in comparing SIP and SIPS URIs. o  Characters other than those in the "reserved" set (see RFC 2396
         [5]) are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding. o  An IP address that is the result of a DNS lookup of a host name
         does not match that host name. o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
         components must match. A URI omitting the user component will not match a URI that
         includes one. A URI omitting the password component will not
         match a URI that includes one. A URI omitting any component with a default value will not
         match a URI explicitly containing that component with its
         default value. For instance, a URI omitting the optional port
         component will not match a URI explicitly declaring port 5060. The same is true for the transport-parameter, ttl-parameter,
         user-parameter, and method components.
