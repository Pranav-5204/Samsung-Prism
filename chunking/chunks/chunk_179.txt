SIP uses an offer/answer model where one UA sends a session
   description, called the offer, which contains a proposed description
   of the session. The offer indicates the desired communications means
   (audio, video, games), parameters of those means (such as codec
   types) and addresses for receiving media from the answerer. The
   other UA responds with another session description, called the
   answer, which indicates which communications means are accepted, the
   parameters that apply to those means, and addresses for receiving
   media from the offerer. An offer/answer exchange is within the
   context of a dialog, so that if a SIP INVITE results in multiple
   dialogs, each is a separate offer/answer exchange. The offer/answer
   model defines restrictions on when offers and answers can be made
   (for example, you cannot make a new offer while one is in progress). This results in restrictions on where the offers and answers can
   appear in SIP messages.
