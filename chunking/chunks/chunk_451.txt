An example of the WWW-Authenticate header field in a 401 challenge
   is:
      WWW-Authenticate: Digest
              realm="biloxi.com",
              qop="auth,auth-int",
              nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
              opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"
   When the originating UAC receives the 401 (Unauthorized), it SHOULD,
   if it is able, re-originate the request with the proper credentials. The UAC may require input from the originating user before
   proceeding. Once authentication credentials have been supplied
   (either directly by the user, or discovered in an internal keyring),
   UAs SHOULD cache the credentials for a given value of the To header
   field and "realm" and attempt to re-use these values on the next
   request for that destination. UAs MAY cache credentials in any way
   they would like.
