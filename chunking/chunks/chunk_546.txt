Because the UA has already authenticated the server on the other
      side of the TLS connection, all requests that come over this
      connection are known to have passed through the proxy server -
      attackers cannot create spoofed requests that appear to have been
      sent through that proxy server. 26.3.2.2 Interdomain Requests
   Now let’s say that Alice’s UA would like to initiate a session with a
   user in a remote administrative domain, namely "bob@biloxi.com". We
   will also say that the local administrative domain (atlanta.com) has
   a local outbound proxy. The proxy server that handles inbound requests for an administrative
   domain MAY also act as a local outbound proxy; for simplicity’s sake
   we’ll assume this to be the case for atlanta.com (otherwise the user
   agent would initiate a new TLS connection to a separate server at
   this point).
