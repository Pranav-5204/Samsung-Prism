Find Context
         The proxy locates the "response context" it created before
         forwarding the original request using the key described in
         Section 16.6. The remaining processing steps take place in
         this context. 2. Update timer C for provisional responses
         For an INVITE transaction, if the response is a provisional
         response with status codes 101 to 199 inclusive (i.e., anything
         but 100), the proxy MUST reset timer C for that client
         transaction. The timer MAY be reset to a different value, but
         this value MUST be greater than 3 minutes. 3. Via
         The proxy removes the topmost Via header field value from the
         response. If no Via header field values remain in the response, the
         response was meant for this element and MUST NOT be forwarded.
