If the TU wishes to send an ACK, it passes one
   directly to the transport layer for transmission. The INVITE transaction is different from those of other methods
   because of its extended duration. Normally, human input is required
   in order to respond to an INVITE. The long delays expected for
   sending a response argue for a three-way handshake. On the other
   hand, requests of other methods are expected to complete rapidly. Because of the non-INVITE transactionâ€™s reliance on a two-way
   handshake, TUs SHOULD respond immediately to non-INVITE requests. 17.1.1 INVITE Client Transaction
17.1.1.1 Overview of INVITE Transaction
   The INVITE transaction consists of a three-way handshake. The client
   transaction sends an INVITE, the server transaction sends responses,
   and the client transaction sends an ACK. For unreliable transports
   (such as UDP), the client transaction retransmits requests at an
   interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles after every
   retransmission.
