Cores, except for the stateless
   proxy, are transaction users. While the behavior of the UAC and UAS
   cores depends on the method, there are some common rules for all
   methods (Section 8). For a UAC, these rules govern the construction
   of a request; for a UAS, they govern the processing of a request and
   generating a response. Since registrations play an important role in
   SIP, a UAS that handles a REGISTER is given the special name
   registrar. Section 10 describes UAC and UAS core behavior for the
   REGISTER method. Section 11 describes UAC and UAS core behavior for
   the OPTIONS method, used for determining the capabilities of a UA. Certain other requests are sent within a dialog. A dialog is a
   peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents that persists
   for some time. The dialog facilitates sequencing of messages and
   proper routing of requests between the user agents. The INVITE
   method is the only way defined in this specification to establish a
   dialog.
