If that
         connection attempt fails, the server SHOULD use the procedures
         in [4] for servers in order to determine the IP address and
         port to open the connection and send the response to. o  Otherwise, if the Via header field value contains a "maddr"
         parameter, the response MUST be forwarded to the address listed
         there, using the port indicated in "sent-by", or port 5060 if
         none is present. If the address is a multicast address, the
         response SHOULD be sent using the TTL indicated in the "ttl"
         parameter, or with a TTL of 1 if that parameter is not present. o  Otherwise (for unreliable unicast transports), if the top Via
         has a "received" parameter, the response MUST be sent to the
         address in the "received" parameter, using the port indicated
         in the "sent-by" value, or using port 5060 if none is specified
         explicitly.
