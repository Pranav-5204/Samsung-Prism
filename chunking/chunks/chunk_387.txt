Example:
      Alert-Info: <http://www.example.com/sounds/moo.wav>
20.5 Allow
   The Allow header field lists the set of methods supported by the UA
   generating the message. All methods, including ACK and CANCEL, understood by the UA MUST be
   included in the list of methods in the Allow header field, when
   present. The absence of an Allow header field MUST NOT be
   interpreted to mean that the UA sending the message supports no
   methods. Rather, it implies that the UA is not providing any
   information on what methods it supports. Supplying an Allow header field in responses to methods other than
   OPTIONS reduces the number of messages needed. Example:
      Allow: INVITE, ACK, OPTIONS, CANCEL, BYE
20.6 Authentication-Info
   The Authentication-Info header field provides for mutual
   authentication with HTTP Digest. A UAS MAY include this header field
   in a 2xx response to a request that was successfully authenticated
   using digest based on the Authorization header field.
