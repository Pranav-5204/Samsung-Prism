All future REGISTER requests from the
   originating UA would then go to chicago.com. Prevention of this threat requires a means by which UAs can
   authenticate the servers to whom they send requests. 26.1.3 Tampering with Message Bodies
   As a matter of course, SIP UAs route requests through trusted proxy
   servers. Regardless of how that trust is established (authentication
   of proxies is discussed elsewhere in this section), a UA may trust a
   proxy server to route a request, but not to inspect or possibly
   modify the bodies contained in that request. Consider a UA that is using SIP message bodies to communicate session
   encryption keys for a media session. Although it trusts the proxy
   server of the domain it is contacting to deliver signaling properly,
   it may not want the administrators of that domain to be capable of
   decrypting any subsequent media session.
