Use of the "*" Contact header field value allows a registering UA
      to remove all bindings associated with an address-of-record
      without knowing their precise values. 10.2.3 Fetching Bindings
   A success response to any REGISTER request contains the complete list
   of existing bindings, regardless of whether the request contained a
   Contact header field. If no Contact header field is present in a
   REGISTER request, the list of bindings is left unchanged. 10.2.4 Refreshing Bindings
   Each UA is responsible for refreshing the bindings that it has
   previously established. A UA SHOULD NOT refresh bindings set up by
   other UAs. The 200 (OK) response from the registrar contains a list of Contact
   fields enumerating all current bindings. The UA compares each
   contact address to see if it created the contact address, using
   comparison rules in Section 19.1.4.
