Note that in some instances, header fields that have been
   communicated in the contact address may instead append to existing
   request header fields in the original redirected request. As a
   general rule, if the header field can accept a comma-separated list
   of values, then the new header field value MAY be appended to any
   existing values in the original redirected request. If the header
   field does not accept multiple values, the value in the original
   redirected request MAY be overwritten by the header field value
   communicated in the contact address. For example, if a contact
   address is returned with the following value:
      sip:user@host?Subject=foo&Call-Info=<http://www.foo.com>
   Then any Subject header field in the original redirected request is
   overwritten, but the HTTP URL is merely appended to any existing
   Call-Info header field values.
