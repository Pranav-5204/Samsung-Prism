This header field, along with Authorization, breaks the general rules
   about multiple header field names. Although not a comma-separated
   list, this header field name may be present multiple times, and MUST
   NOT be combined into a single header line using the usual rules
   described in Section 7.3.1. Example:
   Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="Alice", realm="atlanta.com",
      nonce="c60f3082ee1212b402a21831ae",
      response="245f23415f11432b3434341c022"
20.29 Proxy-Require
   The Proxy-Require header field is used to indicate proxy-sensitive
   features that must be supported by the proxy. See Section 20.32 for
   more details on the mechanics of this message and a usage example. Example:
      Proxy-Require: foo
20.30 Record-Route
   The Record-Route header field is inserted by proxies in a request to
   force future requests in the dialog to be routed through the proxy. Examples of its use with the Route header field are described in
   Sections 16.12.1.
