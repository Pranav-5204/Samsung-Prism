In summary, the mutual authentication of proxy servers through
   mechanisms such as TLS significantly reduces the potential for rogue
   intermediaries to introduce falsified requests or responses that can
   deny service. This commensurately makes it harder for attackers to
   make innocent SIP nodes into agents of amplification. 26.4 Limitations
   Although these security mechanisms, when applied in a judicious
   manner, can thwart many threats, there are limitations in the scope
   of the mechanisms that must be understood by implementers and network
   operators. 26.4.1 HTTP Digest
   One of the primary limitations of using HTTP Digest in SIP is that
   the integrity mechanisms in Digest do not work very well for SIP. Specifically, they offer protection of the Request-URI and the method
   of a message, but not for any of the header fields that UAs would
   most likely wish to secure.
