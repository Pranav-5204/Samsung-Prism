If the URI is not enclosed in angle
   brackets, any semicolon-delimited parameters are header-parameters,
   not URI parameters. 20.1 Accept
   The Accept header field follows the syntax defined in [H14.1]. The
   semantics are also identical, with the exception that if no Accept
   header field is present, the server SHOULD assume a default value of
   application/sdp. An empty Accept header field means that no formats are acceptable.
