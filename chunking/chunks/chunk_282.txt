Now, U1 sets its
   dialog state’s remote target URI to sip:callee@u2.domain.com and its
   route set to:
      (<sip:p1.example.com;lr>,<sip:p2.domain.com;lr>)
   Since all the route set elements contain the lr parameter, U1
   constructs the following BYE request:
      BYE sip:callee@u2.domain.com SIP/2.0
      Route: <sip:p1.example.com;lr>,<sip:p2.domain.com;lr>
   As any other element (including proxies) would do, it resolves the
   URI in the topmost Route header field value using DNS to determine
   where to send the request. This goes to P1. P1 notices that it is
   not responsible for the resource indicated in the Request-URI so it
   doesn’t change it.
