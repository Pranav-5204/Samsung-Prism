If the Max-Forwards
   value reaches 0 before the request reaches its destination, it will
   be rejected with a 483(Too Many Hops) error response. A UAC MUST insert a Max-Forwards header field into each request it
   originates with a value that SHOULD be 70. This number was chosen to
   be sufficiently large to guarantee that a request would not be
   dropped in any SIP network when there were no loops, but not so large
   as to consume proxy resources when a loop does occur. Lower values
   should be used with caution and only in networks where topologies are
   known by the UA. 8.1.1.7 Via
   The Via header field indicates the transport used for the transaction
   and identifies the location where the response is to be sent. A Via
   header field value is added only after the transport that will be
   used to reach the next hop has been selected (which may involve the
   usage of the procedures in [4]). When the UAC creates a request, it MUST insert a Via into that
   request.
