Any information in or about the request or the current environment of
   the element MAY be used in the construction of the target set. For
   instance, different sets may be constructed depending on contents or
   the presence of header fields and bodies, the time of day of the
   request’s arrival, the interface on which the request arrived,
   failure of previous requests, or even the element’s current level of
   utilization. As potential targets are located through these services, their URIs
   are added to the target set. Targets can only be placed in the
   target set once. If a target URI is already present in the set
   (based on the definition of equality for the URI type), it MUST NOT
   be added again. A proxy MUST NOT add additional targets to the target set if the
   Request-URI of the original request does not indicate a resource this
   proxy is responsible for. A proxy can only change the Request-URI of a request during
      forwarding if it is responsible for that URI.
