An attacker preying on this architecture would, for example, be
      unable to forge a BYE request and insert it into the signaling
      stream between Bob and Alice because the attacker has no way of
      ascertaining the parameters of the session and also because the
      integrity mechanism transitively protects the traffic between
      Alice and Bob. 26.3.2.3 Peer-to-Peer Requests
   Alternatively, consider a UA asserting the identity
   "carol@chicago.com" that has no local outbound proxy. When Carol
   wishes to send an INVITE to "bob@biloxi.com", her UA SHOULD initiate
   a TLS connection with the biloxi proxy directly (using the mechanism
   described in [4] to determine how to best to reach the given
   Request-URI). When her UA receives a certificate from the biloxi
   proxy, it SHOULD be verified normally before she passes her INVITE
   across the TLS connection.
