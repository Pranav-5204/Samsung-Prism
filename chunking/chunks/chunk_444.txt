Any time
   that a proxy server or UA receives a request (with the exceptions
   given in Section 22.1), it MAY challenge the initiator of the request
   to provide assurance of its identity. Once the originator has been
   identified, the recipient of the request SHOULD ascertain whether or
   not this user is authorized to make the request in question. No
   authorization systems are recommended or discussed in this document. The "Digest" authentication mechanism described in this section
   provides message authentication and replay protection only, without
   message integrity or confidentiality. Protective measures above and
   beyond those provided by Digest need to be taken to prevent active
   attackers from modifying SIP requests and responses. Note that due to its weak security, the usage of "Basic"
   authentication has been deprecated. Servers MUST NOT accept
   credentials using the "Basic" authorization scheme, and servers also
   MUST NOT challenge with "Basic".
