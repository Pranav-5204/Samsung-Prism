When the
   client decides to send the CANCEL, it creates a client transaction
   for the CANCEL and passes it the CANCEL request along with the
   destination address, port, and transport. The destination address,
   port, and transport for the CANCEL MUST be identical to those used to
   send the original request. If it was allowed to send the CANCEL before receiving a response
      for the previous request, the server could receive the CANCEL
      before the original request. Note that both the transaction corresponding to the original request
   and the CANCEL transaction will complete independently. However, a
   UAC canceling a request cannot rely on receiving a 487 (Request
   Terminated) response for the original request, as an RFC 2543-
   compliant UAS will not generate such a response.
