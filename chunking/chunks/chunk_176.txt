Once it receives a final response, the UAC needs to send an ACK for
   every final response it receives. The procedure for sending this ACK
   depends on the type of response. For final responses between 300 and
   699, the ACK processing is done in the transaction layer and follows
   one set of rules (See Section 17). For 2xx responses, the ACK is
   generated by the UAC core. A 2xx response to an INVITE establishes a session, and it also
   creates a dialog between the UA that issued the INVITE and the UA
   that generated the 2xx response. Therefore, when multiple 2xx
   responses are received from different remote UAs (because the INVITE
   forked), each 2xx establishes a different dialog. All these dialogs
   are part of the same call. This section provides details on the establishment of a session using
   INVITE. A UA that supports INVITE MUST also support ACK, CANCEL and
   BYE.
