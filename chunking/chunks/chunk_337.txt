With
      the extra buffer, the response can be about 170 bytes larger than
      the request, and still not be fragmented on IPv4 (about 30 bytes       is consumed by IP/UDP, assuming no IPSec). 1300 is chosen when
      path MTU is not known, based on the assumption of a 1500 byte
      Ethernet MTU. If an element sends a request over TCP because of these message size
   constraints, and that request would have otherwise been sent over
   UDP, if the attempt to establish the connection generates either an
   ICMP Protocol Not Supported, or results in a TCP reset, the element
   SHOULD retry the request, using UDP. This is only to provide
   backwards compatibility with RFC 2543 compliant implementations that
   do not support TCP. It is anticipated that this behavior will be
   deprecated in a future revision of this specification.
