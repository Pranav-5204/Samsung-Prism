Not every response to a request to which a proxy adds a
         Record-Route header field value will contain a Record-Route
         header field. If the response does contain a Record-Route
         header field, it will contain the value the proxy added. 9. Forward response
         After performing the processing described in steps "Aggregate
         Authorization Header Field Values" through "Record-Route", the
         proxy MAY perform any feature specific manipulations on the
         selected response. The proxy MUST NOT add to, modify, or
         remove the message body. Unless otherwise specified, the proxy
         MUST NOT remove any header field values other than the Via
         header field value discussed in Section 16.7 Item 3. In
         particular, the proxy MUST NOT remove any "received" parameter          it may have added to the next Via header field value while
         processing the request associated with this response.
