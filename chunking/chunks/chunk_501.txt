   A CRLF is allowed in the definition of TEXT-UTF8-TRIM only as part of
   a header field continuation. It is expected that the folding LWS
   will be replaced with a single SP before interpretation of the TEXT-
   UTF8-TRIM value. Hexadecimal numeric characters are used in several protocol elements. Some elements (authentication) force hex alphas to be lower case. LHEX  =  DIGIT / %x61-66 ;lowercase a-f
   Many SIP header field values consist of words separated by LWS or
   special characters. Unless otherwise stated, tokens are case-
   insensitive.
