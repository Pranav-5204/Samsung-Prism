An optional comment can be used to indicate additional information
   about the time of callback. An optional "duration" parameter
   indicates how long the called party will be reachable starting at the
   initial time of availability. If no duration parameter is given, the
   service is assumed to be available indefinitely. Examples:
      Retry-After: 18000;duration=3600
      Retry-After: 120 (Iâ€™m in a meeting)
20.34 Route
   The Route header field is used to force routing for a request through
   the listed set of proxies. Examples of the use of the Route header
   field are in Section 16.12.1. Example:
      Route: <sip:bigbox3.site3.atlanta.com;lr>,
             <sip:server10.biloxi.com;lr>
20.35 Server
   The Server header field contains information about the software used
   by the UAS to handle the request. Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the
   server to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is
   known to contain security holes.
