When a proxy server issues a challenge in response to a request,
      it will not proxy the request until the UAC has retried the
      request with valid credentials. A forking proxy may forward a
      request simultaneously to multiple proxy servers that require
      authentication, each of which in turn will not forward the request
      until the originating UAC has authenticated itself in their
      respective realm. If the UAC does not provide credentials for
      each challenge, the proxy servers that issued the challenges will
      not forward requests to the UA where the destination user might be
      located, and therefore, the virtues of forking are largely lost.
