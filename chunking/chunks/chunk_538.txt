26.2.4 S/MIME
   As is discussed above, encrypting entire SIP messages end-to-end for
   the purpose of confidentiality is not appropriate because network
   intermediaries (like proxy servers) need to view certain header
   fields in order to route messages correctly, and if these
   intermediaries are excluded from security associations, then SIP
   messages will essentially be non-routable. However, S/MIME allows SIP UAs to encrypt MIME bodies within SIP,
   securing these bodies end-to-end without affecting message headers. S/MIME can provide end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for
   message bodies, as well as mutual authentication. It is also
   possible to use S/MIME to provide a form of integrity and
   confidentiality for SIP header fields through SIP message tunneling. The usage of S/MIME in SIP is detailed in Section 23.
