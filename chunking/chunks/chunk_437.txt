The user could also be available
   elsewhere, such as through a voice mail service. Status 600 (Busy
   Everywhere) SHOULD be used if the client knows that no other end
   system will be able to accept this call. 21.4.25 487 Request Terminated
   The request was terminated by a BYE or CANCEL request. This response
   is never returned for a CANCEL request itself. 21.4.26 488 Not Acceptable Here
   The response has the same meaning as 606 (Not Acceptable), but only
   applies to the specific resource addressed by the Request-URI and the
   request may succeed elsewhere. A message body containing a description of media capabilities MAY be
   present in the response, which is formatted according to the Accept
   header field in the INVITE (or application/sdp if not present), the
   same as a message body in a 200 (OK) response to an OPTIONS request. 21.4.27 491 Request Pending
   The request was received by a UAS that had a pending request within
   the same dialog.
