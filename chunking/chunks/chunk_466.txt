The PGP mechanism for encrypting the header fields and bodies of
      SIP messages described in RFC 2543 has been deprecated. 23.1 S/MIME Certificates
   The certificates that are used to identify an end-user for the
   purposes of S/MIME differ from those used by servers in one important
   respect - rather than asserting that the identity of the holder
   corresponds to a particular hostname, these certificates assert that
   the holder is identified by an end-user address. This address is
   composed of the concatenation of the "userinfo" "@" and "domainname"
   portions of a SIP or SIPS URI (in other words, an email address of
   the form "bob@biloxi.com"), most commonly corresponding to a userâ€™s
   address-of-record. These certificates are also associated with keys that are used to
   sign or encrypt bodies of SIP messages.
