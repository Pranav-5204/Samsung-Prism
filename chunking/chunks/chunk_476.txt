However, if a user agent that supports S/MIME receives a request with
   an unsecured body, it SHOULD NOT respond with a secured body, but if
   it expects S/MIME from the sender (for example, because the senderâ€™s
   From header field value corresponds to an identity on its keychain),
   the UAS SHOULD notify its user that the session could not be secured. A number of conditions that arise in the previous text call for the
   notification of the user when an anomalous certificate-management
   event occurs. Users might well ask what they should do under these
   circumstances. First and foremost, an unexpected change in a
   certificate, or an absence of security when security is expected, are    causes for caution but not necessarily indications that an attack is
   in progress. Users might abort any connection attempt or refuse a
   connection request they have received; in telephony parlance, they
   could hang up and call back.
