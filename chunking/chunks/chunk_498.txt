Section 6.1 of RFC 2234 defines a set of core rules that
   are used by this specification, and not repeated here. Implementers
   need to be familiar with the notation and content of RFC 2234 in
   order to understand this specification. Certain basic rules are in
   uppercase, such as SP, LWS, HTAB, CRLF, DIGIT, ALPHA, etc. Angle
   brackets are used within definitions to clarify the use of rule
   names. The use of square brackets is redundant syntactically. It is used as
   a semantic hint that the specific parameter is optional to use. 25.1 Basic Rules
   The following rules are used throughout this specification to
   describe basic parsing constructs. The US-ASCII coded character set
   is defined by ANSI X3.4-1986. alphanum  =  ALPHA / DIGIT
   Several rules are incorporated from RFC 2396 [5] but are updated to
   make them compliant with RFC 2234 [10]. These include:
      reserved    =  ";" / "/" / "?"
