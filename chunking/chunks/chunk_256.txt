Under the new rules, upon
         receiving a 6xx, a proxy will issue a CANCEL request, which
         will generally result in 487 responses from all outstanding
         client transactions, and then at that point the 6xx is
         forwarded upstream. After a final response has been sent on the server transaction,
         the following responses MUST be forwarded immediately:
         -  Any 2xx response to an INVITE request
         A stateful proxy MUST NOT immediately forward any other
         responses. In particular, a stateful proxy MUST NOT forward
         any 100 (Trying) response. Those responses that are candidates
         for forwarding later as the "best" response have been gathered
         as described in step "Add Response to Context". Any response chosen for immediate forwarding MUST be processed
         as described in steps "Aggregate Authorization Header Field
         Values" through "Record-Route".
