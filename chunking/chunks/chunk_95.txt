With other 4xx responses, including those yet to be defined, a retry
   may or may not be possible depending on the method and the use case. 8.2 UAS Behavior
   When a request outside of a dialog is processed by a UAS, there is a
   set of processing rules that are followed, independent of the method. Section 12 gives guidance on how a UAS can tell whether a request is
   inside or outside of a dialog. Note that request processing is atomic. If a request is accepted,
   all state changes associated with it MUST be performed. If it is
   rejected, all state changes MUST NOT be performed. UASs SHOULD process the requests in the order of the steps that
   follow in this section (that is, starting with authentication, then
   inspecting the method, the header fields, and so on throughout the
   remainder of this section). 8.2.1 Method Inspection
   Once a request is authenticated (or authentication is skipped), the
   UAS MUST inspect the method of the request.
