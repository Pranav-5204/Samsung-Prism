In this specification, offers and answers
   can only appear in INVITE requests and responses, and ACK. The usage
   of offers and answers is further restricted. For the initial INVITE
   transaction, the rules are:
      o  The initial offer MUST be in either an INVITE or, if not there,
         in the first reliable non-failure message from the UAS back to
         the UAC. In this specification, that is the final 2xx
         response. o  If the initial offer is in an INVITE, the answer MUST be in a
         reliable non-failure message from UAS back to UAC which is
         correlated to that INVITE. For this specification, that is
         only the final 2xx response to that INVITE. That same exact
         answer MAY also be placed in any provisional responses sent
         prior to the answer. The UAC MUST treat the first session
         description it receives as the answer, and MUST ignore any
         session descriptions in subsequent responses to the initial
         INVITE.
