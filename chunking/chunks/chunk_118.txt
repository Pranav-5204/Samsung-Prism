If there is no
   final response for the original request in 64*T1 seconds (T1 is    defined in Section 17.1.1.1), the client SHOULD then consider the
   original transaction cancelled and SHOULD destroy the client
   transaction handling the original request. 9.2 Server Behavior
   The CANCEL method requests that the TU at the server side cancel a
   pending transaction. The TU determines the transaction to be
   cancelled by taking the CANCEL request, and then assuming that the
   request method is anything but CANCEL or ACK and applying the
   transaction matching procedures of Section 17.2.3. The matching
   transaction is the one to be cancelled. The processing of a CANCEL request at a server depends on the type of
   server. A stateless proxy will forward it, a stateful proxy might
   respond to it and generate some CANCEL requests of its own, and a UAS
   will respond to it. See Section 16.10 for proxy treatment of CANCEL.
