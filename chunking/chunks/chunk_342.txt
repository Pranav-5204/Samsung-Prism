If there is a
   match, the response MUST be passed to that transaction. Otherwise,
   the response MUST be passed to the core (whether it be stateless
   proxy, stateful proxy, or UA) for further processing. Handling of
   these "stray" responses is dependent on the core (a proxy will
   forward them, while a UA will discard, for example). 18.2 Servers
18.2.1 Receiving Requests
   A server SHOULD be prepared to receive requests on any IP address,
   port and transport combination that can be the result of a DNS lookup
   on a SIP or SIPS URI [4] that is handed out for the purposes of
   communicating with that server. In this context, "handing out"
   includes placing a URI in a Contact header field in a REGISTER
   request or a redirect response, or in a Record-Route header field in
   a request or response. A URI can also be "handed out" by placing it
   on a web page or business card.
