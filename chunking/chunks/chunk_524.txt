   inspected or altered by proxy servers as a request is routed, not all
   header fields should be secured end-to-end. For these reasons, the UA might want to secure SIP message bodies,
   and in some limited cases header fields, end-to-end. The security
   services required for bodies include confidentiality, integrity, and
   authentication. These end-to-end services should be independent of
   the means used to secure interactions with intermediaries such as
   proxy servers. 26.1.4 Tearing Down Sessions
