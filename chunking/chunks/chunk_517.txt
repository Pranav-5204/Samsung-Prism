The considerations that follow first examine a set of classic threat
   models that broadly identify the security needs of SIP. The set of
   security services required to address these threats is then detailed,
   followed by an explanation of several security mechanisms that can be
   used to provide these services. Next, the requirements for
   implementers of SIP are enumerated, along with exemplary deployments
   in which these security mechanisms could be used to improve the
   security of SIP. Some notes on privacy conclude this section. 26.1 Attacks and Threat Models
   This section details some threats that should be common to most
   deployments of SIP. These threats have been chosen specifically to
   illustrate each of the security services that SIP requires.
