If the address-of-record in the To header field of a REGISTER request
   is a SIPS URI, then any Contact header field values in the request
   SHOULD also be SIPS URIs. Clients should only register non-SIPS URIs
   under a SIPS address-of-record when the security of the resource
   represented by the contact address is guaranteed by other means. This may be applicable to URIs that invoke protocols other than SIP,
   or SIP devices secured by protocols other than TLS. Registrations do not need to update all bindings. Typically, a UA
   only updates its own contact addresses. 10.2.1.1 Setting the Expiration Interval of Contact Addresses
   When a client sends a REGISTER request, it MAY suggest an expiration
   interval that indicates how long the client would like the
   registration to be valid. (As described in Section 10.3, the
   registrar selects the actual time interval based on its local
   policy.)
