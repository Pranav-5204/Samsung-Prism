If any one of them fails (for
         example, because the back-end database commit failed), the
         request MUST fail with a 500 (Server Error) response and all
         tentative binding updates MUST be removed. 8. The registrar returns a 200 (OK) response. The response MUST
         contain Contact header field values enumerating all current
         bindings. Each Contact value MUST feature an "expires"
         parameter indicating its expiration interval chosen by the
         registrar. The response SHOULD include a Date header field. 11 Querying for Capabilities
   The SIP method OPTIONS allows a UA to query another UA or a proxy
   server as to its capabilities. This allows a client to discover
   information about the supported methods, content types, extensions,
   codecs, etc. without "ringing" the other party.
