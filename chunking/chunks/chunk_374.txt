19.1.6 Relating SIP URIs and tel URLs
   When a tel URL (RFC 2806 [9]) is converted to a SIP or SIPS URI, the
   entire telephone-subscriber portion of the tel URL, including any
   parameters, is placed into the userinfo part of the SIP or SIPS URI. Thus, tel:+358-555-1234567;postd=pp22 becomes
      sip:+358-555-1234567;postd=pp22@foo.com;user=phone
   or
      sips:+358-555-1234567;postd=pp22@foo.com;user=phone
   not
      sip:+358-555-1234567@foo.com;postd=pp22;user=phone
   or
      sips:+358-555-1234567@foo.com;postd=pp22;user=phone
   In general, equivalent "tel" URLs converted to SIP or SIPS URIs in
   this fashion may not produce equivalent SIP or SIPS URIs. The
   userinfo of SIP and SIPS URIs are compared as a case-sensitive
   string. Variance in case-insensitive portions of tel URLs and
   reordering of tel URL parameters does not affect tel URL equivalence,
   but does affect the equivalence of SIP URIs formed from them.
