Matching is done based on the matching    rules defined for each of those header fields. When a non-INVITE
   request matches an existing transaction, it is a retransmission of
   the request that created that transaction. Because the matching rules include the Request-URI, the server cannot
   match a response to a transaction. When the TU passes a response to
   the server transaction, it must pass it to the specific server
   transaction for which the response is targeted. 17.2.4 Handling Transport Errors
   When the server transaction sends a response to the transport layer
   to be sent, the following procedures are followed if the transport
   layer indicates a failure. First, the procedures in [4] are followed, which attempt to deliver
   the response to a backup. If those should all fail, based on the
   definition of failure in [4], the server transaction SHOULD inform
   the TU that a failure has occurred, and SHOULD transition to the
   terminated state.
