This request
   may be forwarded by proxies, eventually arriving at one or more UAS
   that can potentially accept the invitation. These UASs will
   frequently need to query the user about whether to accept the    invitation. After some time, those UASs can accept the invitation
   (meaning the session is to be established) by sending a 2xx response. If the invitation is not accepted, a 3xx, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response is
   sent, depending on the reason for the rejection. Before sending a
   final response, the UAS can also send provisional responses (1xx) to
   advise the UAC of progress in contacting the called user. After possibly receiving one or more provisional responses, the UAC
   will get one or more 2xx responses or one non-2xx final response. Because of the protracted amount of time it can take to receive final
   responses to INVITE, the reliability mechanisms for INVITE
   transactions differ from those of other requests (like OPTIONS).
