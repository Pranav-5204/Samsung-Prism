If a provisional response
   has a tag in the To field, and if the dialog ID of the response does
   not match an existing dialog, one is constructed using the procedures
   defined in Section 12.1.2. The early dialog will only be needed if the UAC needs to send a
   request to its peer within the dialog before the initial INVITE
   transaction completes. Header fields present in a provisional
   response are applicable as long as the dialog is in the early state
   (for example, an Allow header field in a provisional response
   contains the methods that can be used in the dialog while this is in
   the early state). 13.2.2.2 3xx Responses
   A 3xx response may contain one or more Contact header field values
   providing new addresses where the callee might be reachable. Depending on the status code of the 3xx response (see Section 21.3),
   the UAC MAY choose to try those new addresses. 13.2.2.3 4xx, 5xx and 6xx Responses
   A single non-2xx final response may be received for the INVITE.
