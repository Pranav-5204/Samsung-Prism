The BNF in RFC 2617 has an error in that the ’uri’ parameter
          of the Authorization header field for HTTP Digest
          authentication is not enclosed in quotation marks. (The
          example in Section 3.5 of RFC 2617 is correct.) For SIP, the
          ’uri’ MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. 3. The BNF for digest-uri-value is:
          digest-uri-value  =  Request-URI ; as defined in Section 25
      4. The example procedure for choosing a nonce based on Etag does
          not work for SIP. 5. The text in RFC 2617 [17] regarding cache operation does not
          apply to SIP. 6. RFC 2617 [17] requires that a server check that the URI in the
          request line and the URI included in the Authorization header
          field point to the same resource. In a SIP context, these two
          URIs may refer to different users, due to forwarding at some
          proxy.
