When users move between devices, it may be difficult to transport
   private keys securely between UAs; how such keys might be acquired by
   a device is outside the scope of this document. Another, more prosaic difficulty with the S/MIME mechanism is that it
   can result in very large messages, especially when the SIP tunneling
   mechanism described in Section 23.4 is used. For that reason, it is
   RECOMMENDED that TCP should be used as a transport protocol when
   S/MIME tunneling is employed. 26.4.3 TLS
   The most commonly voiced concern about TLS is that it cannot run over
   UDP; TLS requires a connection-oriented underlying transport
   protocol, which for the purposes of this document means TCP. It may also be arduous for a local outbound proxy server and/or
   registrar to maintain many simultaneous long-lived TLS connections
   with numerous UAs. This introduces some valid scalability concerns,
   especially for intensive ciphersuites.
