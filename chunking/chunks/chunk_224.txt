If the domain of the Request-URI indicates a domain this element is
   not responsible for, the Request-URI MUST be placed into the target
   set as the only target, and the element MUST proceed to the task of
   Request Forwarding (Section 16.6). There are many circumstances in which a proxy might receive a
      request for a domain it is not responsible for. A firewall proxy
      handling outgoing calls (the way HTTP proxies handle outgoing
      requests) is an example of where this is likely to occur. If the target set for the request has not been predetermined as
   described above, this implies that the element is responsible for the
   domain in the Request-URI, and the element MAY use whatever mechanism
   it desires to determine where to send the request. Any of these
   mechanisms can be modeled as accessing an abstract Location Service.
