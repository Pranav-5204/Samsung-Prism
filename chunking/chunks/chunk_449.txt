When a UAC receives a challenge, it SHOULD render to the user the
   contents of the "realm" parameter in the challenge (which appears in
   either a WWW-Authenticate header field or Proxy-Authenticate header
   field) if the UAC device does not already know of a credential for
   the realm in question. A service provider that pre-configures UAs
   with credentials for its realm should be aware that users will not
   have the opportunity to present their own credentials for this realm
   when challenged at a pre-configured device. Finally, note that even if a UAC can locate credentials that are
   associated with the proper realm, the potential exists that these
   credentials may no longer be valid or that the challenging server
   will not accept these credentials for whatever reason (especially
   when "anonymous" with no password is submitted). In this instance a
   server may repeat its challenge, or it may respond with a 403
   Forbidden.
