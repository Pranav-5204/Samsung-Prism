These six header fields are the fundamental building
   blocks of a SIP message, as they jointly provide for most of the
   critical message routing services including the addressing of
   messages, the routing of responses, limiting message propagation,
   ordering of messages, and the unique identification of transactions. These header fields are in addition to the mandatory request line,
   which contains the method, Request-URI, and SIP version. Examples of requests sent outside of a dialog include an INVITE to
   establish a session (Section 13) and an OPTIONS to query for
   capabilities (Section 11). 8.1.1.1 Request-URI
   The initial Request-URI of the message SHOULD be set to the value of
   the URI in the To field. One notable exception is the REGISTER
   method; behavior for setting the Request-URI of REGISTER is given in
   Section 10.
