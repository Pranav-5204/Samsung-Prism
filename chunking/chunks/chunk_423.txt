21.1.1 100 Trying
   This response indicates that the request has been received by the
   next-hop server and that some unspecified action is being taken on
   behalf of this call (for example, a database is being consulted). This response, like all other provisional responses, stops
   retransmissions of an INVITE by a UAC. The 100 (Trying) response is
   different from other provisional responses, in that it is never
   forwarded upstream by a stateful proxy. 21.1.2 180 Ringing
   The UA receiving the INVITE is trying to alert the user. This
   response MAY be used to initiate local ringback. 21.1.3 181 Call Is Being Forwarded
   A server MAY use this status code to indicate that the call is being
   forwarded to a different set of destinations. 21.1.4 182 Queued
   The called party is temporarily unavailable, but the server has
   decided to queue the call rather than reject it. When the callee
   becomes available, it will return the appropriate final status
   response.
