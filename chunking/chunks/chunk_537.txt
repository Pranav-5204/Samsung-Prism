This is a change
      since RFC 2543. Users that distribute a SIPS URI as an address-of-record may elect to
   operate devices that refuse requests over insecure transports. 26.2.3 HTTP Authentication
   SIP provides a challenge capability, based on HTTP authentication,
   that relies on the 401 and 407 response codes as well as header
   fields for carrying challenges and credentials. Without significant
   modification, the reuse of the HTTP Digest authentication scheme in
   SIP allows for replay protection and one-way authentication. The usage of Digest authentication in SIP is detailed in Section 22.
