The client side
   is known as a client transaction and the server side as a server
   transaction. The client transaction sends the request, and the
   server transaction sends the response. The client and server
   transactions are logical functions that are embedded in any number of
   elements. Specifically, they exist within user agents and stateful
   proxy servers. Consider the example in Section 4. In this example,
   the UAC executes the client transaction, and its outbound proxy
   executes the server transaction. The outbound proxy also executes a
   client transaction, which sends the request to a server transaction
   in the inbound proxy. That proxy also executes a client transaction,
   which in turn sends the request to a server transaction in the UAS. This is shown in Figure 4.
