Each header field consists of a field
   name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. field-name: field-value
   The formal grammar for a message-header specified in Section 25
   allows for an arbitrary amount of whitespace on either side of the
   colon; however, implementations should avoid spaces between the field
   name and the colon and use a single space (SP) between the colon and
   the field-value. Subject:            lunch
      Subject      :      lunch
      Subject            :lunch
      Subject: lunch
   Thus, the above are all valid and equivalent, but the last is the
   preferred form. Header fields can be extended over multiple lines by preceding each
   extra line with at least one SP or horizontal tab (HT). The line
   break and the whitespace at the beginning of the next line are
   treated as a single SP character. Thus, the following are
   equivalent:
      Subject: I know youâ€™re there, pick up the phone and talk to me!
