   SIP header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the
   continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear
   white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A
   recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
   interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream. This is intended to behave exactly as HTTP/1.1 as described in RFC
   2616 [8]. The SWS construct is used when linear white space is
   optional, generally between tokens and separators.
