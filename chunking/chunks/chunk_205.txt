If, however, it is
   unacceptable to the UAC, the UAC SHOULD generate an answer with a
   valid session description, and then send a BYE to terminate the
   session. 15 Terminating a Session
   This section describes the procedures for terminating a session
   established by SIP. The state of the session and the state of the
   dialog are very closely related. When a session is initiated with an
   INVITE, each 1xx or 2xx response from a distinct UAS creates a
   dialog, and if that response completes the offer/answer exchange, it
   also creates a session. As a result, each session is "associated"
   with a single dialog - the one which resulted in its creation. If an
   initial INVITE generates a non-2xx final response, that terminates
   all sessions (if any) and all dialogs (if any) that were created
   through responses to the request. By virtue of completing the
   transaction, a non-2xx final response also prevents further sessions
   from being created as a result of the INVITE.
