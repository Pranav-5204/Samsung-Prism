For
   purposes of backwards compatibility, proxy servers, redirect servers,
   and registrars SHOULD support TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. Implementers MAY also support any other ciphersuite. 26.2.2 SIPS URI Scheme
   The SIPS URI scheme adheres to the syntax of the SIP URI (described
   in 19), although the scheme string is "sips" rather than "sip". The
   semantics of SIPS are very different from the SIP URI, however. SIPS
   allows resources to specify that they should be reached securely. A SIPS URI can be used as an address-of-record for a particular user
   - the URI by which the user is canonically known (on their business
   cards, in the From header field of their requests, in the To header
   field of REGISTER requests).
