For the methods defined in this specification, that includes
   only the INVITE request. For these requests, the scope of the
   Contact is global. That is, the Contact header field value contains
   the URI at which the UA would like to receive requests, and this URI
   MUST be valid even if used in subsequent requests outside of any
   dialogs. If the Request-URI or top Route header field value contains a SIPS
   URI, the Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS URI as well. For further information on the Contact header field, see Section
   20.10. 8.1.1.9 Supported and Require
   If the UAC supports extensions to SIP that can be applied by the
   server to the response, the UAC SHOULD include a Supported header
   field in the request listing the option tags (Section 19.2) for those
   extensions. The option tags listed MUST only refer to extensions defined in
   standards-track RFCs.
