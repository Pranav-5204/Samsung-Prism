SIP
   transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, which
   supports personal mobility [27] - users can maintain a single
   externally visible identifier regardless of their network location. SIP supports five facets of establishing and terminating multimedia
   communications:
      User location: determination of the end system to be used for
           communication;
      User availability: determination of the willingness of the called
           party to engage in communications;
      User capabilities: determination of the media and media parameters
           to be used;
      Session setup: "ringing", establishment of session parameters at
           both called and calling party;
      Session management: including transfer and termination of
           sessions, modifying session parameters, and invoking
           services. SIP is not a vertically integrated communications system.
