Only if biloxi.com
   has some other way of knowing atlanta.com’s authentication policies
   could it possibly ascertain how Alice proved her identity. biloxi.com might then institute an even stricter policy that forbids
   requests that come from domains that are not known administratively
   to share a common authentication policy with biloxi.com. Once the INVITE has been approved by the biloxi proxy, the proxy
   server SHOULD identify the existing TLS channel, if any, associated
   with the user targeted by this request (in this case
   "bob@biloxi.com"). The INVITE should be proxied through this channel
   to Bob. Since the request is received over a TLS connection that had
   previously been authenticated as the biloxi proxy, Bob knows that the
   From header field was not tampered with and that atlanta.com has
   validated Alice, although not necessarily whether or not to trust
   Alice’s identity.
