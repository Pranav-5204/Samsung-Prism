An implementation SHOULD NOT honor requests to include header fields
   that may cause it to falsely advertise its location or capabilities. These include: Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Allow,
   Contact (in its dialog usage), Organization, Supported, and User-
   Agent. An implementation SHOULD verify the accuracy of any requested
   descriptive header fields, including: Content-Disposition, Content-
   Encoding, Content-Language, Content-Length, Content-Type, Date,
   Mime-Version, and Timestamp. If the request formed from constructing a message from a given URI is
   not a valid SIP request, the URI is invalid. An implementation MUST
   NOT proceed with transmitting the request. It should instead pursue
   the course of action due an invalid URI in the context it occurs. The constructed request can be invalid in many ways.
