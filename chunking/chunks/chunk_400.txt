However, in its GMT form, it requires clients to know their offset
      from GMT. Example:
      Date: Sat, 13 Nov 2010 23:29:00 GMT
20.18 Error-Info
   The Error-Info header field provides a pointer to additional
   information about the error status response. SIP UACs have user interface capabilities ranging from pop-up
      windows and audio on PC softclients to audio-only on "black"
      phones or endpoints connected via gateways. Rather than forcing a
      server generating an error to choose between sending an error
      status code with a detailed reason phrase and playing an audio
      recording, the Error-Info header field allows both to be sent. The UAC then has the choice of which error indicator to render to
      the caller. A UAC MAY treat a SIP or SIPS URI in an Error-Info header field as if
   it were a Contact in a redirect and generate a new INVITE, resulting
   in a recorded announcement session being established. A non-SIP URI
   MAY be rendered to the user.
