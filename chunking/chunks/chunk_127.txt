Contact: REGISTER requests MAY contain a Contact header field with
           zero or more values containing address bindings. UAs MUST NOT send a new registration (that is, containing new Contact
   header field values, as opposed to a retransmission) until they have
   received a final response from the registrar for the previous one or
   the previous REGISTER request has timed out.
