The local sequence number MUST be set to the value of the sequence
   number in the CSeq header field of the request. The remote sequence
   number MUST be empty (it is established when the remote UA sends a
   request within the dialog). The call identifier component of the
   dialog ID MUST be set to the value of the Call-ID in the request. The local tag component of the dialog ID MUST be set to the tag in
   the From field in the request, and the remote tag component of the
   dialog ID MUST be set to the tag in the To field of the response. A
   UAC MUST be prepared to receive a response without a tag in the To
   field, in which case the tag is considered to have a value of null. This is to maintain backwards compatibility with RFC 2543, which
      did not mandate To tags. The remote URI MUST be set to the URI in the To field, and the local
   URI MUST be set to the URI in the From field.
