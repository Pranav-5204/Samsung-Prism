The
   registrar SHOULD offer a certificate to the UA, and the site
   identified by the certificate MUST correspond with the domain in
   which the UA intends to register; for example, if the UA intends to
   register the address-of-record ’alice@atlanta.com’, the site
   certificate must identify a host within the atlanta.com domain (such
   as sip.atlanta.com). When it receives the TLS Certificate message,
   the UA SHOULD verify the certificate and inspect the site identified
   by the certificate. If the certificate is invalid, revoked, or if it
   does not identify the appropriate party, the UA MUST NOT send the
   REGISTER message and otherwise proceed with the registration. When a valid certificate has been provided by the registrar, the
      UA knows that the registrar is not an attacker who might redirect
      the UA, steal passwords, or attempt any similar attacks.
