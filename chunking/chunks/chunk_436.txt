      Some email and voice mail systems provide this functionality. A
      status code separate from 3xx is used since the semantics are
      different: for 300, it is assumed that the same person or service
      will be reached by the choices provided. While an automated
      choice or sequential search makes sense for a 3xx response, user
      intervention is required for a 485 (Ambiguous) response. 21.4.24 486 Busy Here
