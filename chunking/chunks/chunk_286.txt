P1 notices itself in the topmost Route header field value, so it
   removes it, resulting in:
      BYE sip:caller@u1.example.com SIP/2.0
   Since P1 is not responsible for u1.example.com and there is no Route
   header field, P1 will forward the request to u1.example.com based on
   the Request-URI. 16.12.1.3 Rewriting Record-Route Header Field Values
   In this scenario, U1 and U2 are in different private namespaces and
   they enter a dialog through a proxy P1, which acts as a gateway
   between the namespaces.
