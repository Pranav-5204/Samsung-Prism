A UAS first processes the CANCEL request according to the general UAS
   processing described in Section 8.2. However, since CANCEL requests
   are hop-by-hop and cannot be resubmitted, they cannot be challenged
   by the server in order to get proper credentials in an Authorization
   header field. Note also that CANCEL requests do not contain a
   Require header field. If the UAS did not find a matching transaction for the CANCEL
   according to the procedure above, it SHOULD respond to the CANCEL
   with a 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist). If the transaction
   for the original request still exists, the behavior of the UAS on
   receiving a CANCEL request depends on whether it has already sent a
   final response for the original request. If it has, the CANCEL
   request has no effect on the processing of the original request, no
   effect on any session state, and no effect on the responses generated
   for the original request.
