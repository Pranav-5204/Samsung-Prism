They use a form similar to the mailto URL, allowing the specification
   of SIP request-header fields and the SIP message-body. This makes it
   possible to specify the subject, media type, or urgency of sessions
   initiated by using a URI on a web page or in an email message. The
   formal syntax for a SIP or SIPS URI is presented in Section 25. Its
   general form, in the case of a SIP URI, is:
      sip:user:password@host:port;uri-parameters?headers
   The format for a SIPS URI is the same, except that the scheme is
   "sips" instead of sip. These tokens, and some of the tokens in their
   expansions, have the following meanings:
      user: The identifier of a particular resource at the host being
         addressed. The term "host" in this context frequently refers
         to a domain. The "userinfo" of a URI consists of this user
         field, the password field, and the @ sign following them.
