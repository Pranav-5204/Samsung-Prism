21 Response Codes
   The response codes are consistent with, and extend, HTTP/1.1 response
   codes. Not all HTTP/1.1 response codes are appropriate, and only
   those that are appropriate are given here. Other HTTP/1.1 response
   codes SHOULD NOT be used. Also, SIP defines a new class, 6xx. 21.1 Provisional 1xx
   Provisional responses, also known as informational responses,
   indicate that the server contacted is performing some further action
   and does not yet have a definitive response. A server sends a 1xx
   response if it expects to take more than 200 ms to obtain a final
   response. Note that 1xx responses are not transmitted reliably. They never cause the client to send an ACK. Provisional (1xx)
   responses MAY contain message bodies, including session descriptions.
