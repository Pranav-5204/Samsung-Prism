The combination of the To tag, From tag,
   and Call-ID completely defines a peer-to-peer SIP relationship
   between Alice and Bob and is referred to as a dialog. CSeq or Command Sequence contains an integer and a method name. The
   CSeq number is incremented for each new request within a dialog and
   is a traditional sequence number. Contact contains a SIP or SIPS URI that represents a direct route to
   contact Alice, usually composed of a username at a fully qualified
   domain name (FQDN). While an FQDN is preferred, many end systems do
   not have registered domain names, so IP addresses are permitted. While the Via header field tells other elements where to send the
   response, the Contact header field tells other elements where to send
   future requests. Max-Forwards serves to limit the number of hops a request can make on
   the way to its destination. It consists of an integer that is
   decremented by one at each hop.
