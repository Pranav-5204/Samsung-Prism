UAs wishing to support this capability must
   take into consideration some issues such as choosing monotonically
   increasing CSeq sequence numbers even across reboots, reconstructing
   the route set, and accepting out-of-range RTP timestamps and sequence
   numbers. If the UAS wishes to reject the request because it does not wish to
   recreate the dialog, it MUST respond to the request with a 481
   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) status code and pass that to the
   server transaction. Requests that do not change in any way the state of a dialog may be
   received within a dialog (for example, an OPTIONS request). They are
   processed as if they had been received outside the dialog. If the remote sequence number is empty, it MUST be set to the value
   of the sequence number in the CSeq header field value in the request.
