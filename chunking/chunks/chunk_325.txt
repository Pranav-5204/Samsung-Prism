When this state is entered, timer I is set to fire in T4
   seconds for unreliable transports, and zero seconds for reliable
   transports. Once timer I fires, the server MUST transition to the
   "Terminated" state. Once the transaction is in the "Terminated" state, it MUST be
   destroyed immediately. As with client transactions, this is needed
   to ensure reliability of the 2xx responses to INVITE. 17.2.2 Non-INVITE Server Transaction
   The state machine for the non-INVITE server transaction is shown in
   Figure 8. The state machine is initialized in the "Trying" state and is passed
   a request other than INVITE or ACK when initialized. This request is
   passed up to the TU. Once in the "Trying" state, any further request
   retransmissions are discarded. A request is a retransmission if it
   matches the same server transaction, using the rules specified in
   Section 17.2.3.
