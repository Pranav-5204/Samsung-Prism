If no credentials for a realm can be located, UACs MAY attempt to
   retry the request with a username of "anonymous" and no password (a
   password of ""). Once credentials have been located, any UA that wishes to
   authenticate itself with a UAS or registrar -- usually, but not
   necessarily, after receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response -- MAY do
   so by including an Authorization header field with the request. The
   Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the
   authentication information of the UA for the realm of the resource
   being requested as well as parameters required in support of
   authentication and replay protection.
