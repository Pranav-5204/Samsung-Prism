The BYE request is
   used to terminate a specific session or attempted session. In this
   case, the specific session is the one with the peer UA on the other
   side of the dialog. When a BYE is received on a dialog, any session
   associated with that dialog SHOULD terminate. A UA MUST NOT send a
   BYE outside of a dialog. The caller’s UA MAY send a BYE for either
   confirmed or early dialogs, and the callee’s UA MAY send a BYE on
   confirmed dialogs, but MUST NOT send a BYE on early dialogs. However, the callee’s UA MUST NOT send a BYE on a confirmed dialog
   until it has received an ACK for its 2xx response or until the server
   transaction times out. If no SIP extensions have defined other
   application layer states associated with the dialog, the BYE also
   terminates the dialog. The impact of a non-2xx final response to INVITE on dialogs and
   sessions makes the use of CANCEL attractive. The CANCEL attempts to
   force a non-2xx response to the INVITE (in particular, a 487).
