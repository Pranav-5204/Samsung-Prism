The optional loop detection procedure
      is more fully and correctly specified here. o  Usage of tags is now mandatory (they were optional in RFC 2543),
      as they are now the fundamental building blocks of dialog
      identification. o  Added the Supported header field, allowing for clients to indicate
      what extensions are supported to a server, which can apply those
      extensions to the response, and indicate their usage with a
      Require in the response. o  Extension parameters were missing from the BNF for several header
      fields, and they have been added. o  Handling of Route and Record-Route construction was very
      underspecified in RFC 2543, and also not the right approach. It
      has been substantially reworked in this specification (and made
      vastly simpler), and this is arguably the largest change.
