Assuming that the client has completed the registration    process described in the preceding section, it SHOULD reuse the TLS
   connection to the local proxy server when it sends an INVITE request
   to another user. The UA SHOULD reuse cached credentials in the
   INVITE to avoid prompting the user unnecessarily. When the local outbound proxy server has validated the credentials
   presented by the UA in the INVITE, it SHOULD inspect the Request-URI
   to determine how the message should be routed (see [4]). If the
   "domainname" portion of the Request-URI had corresponded to the local
   domain (atlanta.com) rather than biloxi.com, then the proxy server
   would have consulted its location service to determine how best to
   reach the requested user. Had "alice@atlanta.com" been attempting to contact, say,
      "alex@atlanta.com", the local proxy would have proxied to the
      request to the TLS connection Alex had established with the
      registrar when he registered.
