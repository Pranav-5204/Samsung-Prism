18 Transport
   The transport layer is responsible for the actual transmission of
   requests and responses over network transports. This includes
   determination of the connection to use for a request or response in
   the case of connection-oriented transports. The transport layer is responsible for managing persistent
   connections for transport protocols like TCP and SCTP, or TLS over
   those, including ones opened to the transport layer. This includes
   connections opened by the client or server transports, so that
   connections are shared between client and server transport functions. These connections are indexed by the tuple formed from the address,
   port, and transport protocol at the far end of the connection. When
   a connection is opened by the transport layer, this index is set to
   the destination IP, port and transport. When the connection is
   accepted by the transport layer, this index is set to the source IP
   address, port number, and transport.
