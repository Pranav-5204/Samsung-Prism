Since Alex would receive this
      request over his authenticated channel, he would be assured that
      Aliceâ€™s request had been authorized by the proxy server of the
      local administrative domain. However, in this instance the Request-URI designates a remote domain. The local outbound proxy server at atlanta.com SHOULD therefore
   establish a TLS connection with the remote proxy server at
   biloxi.com. Since both of the participants in this TLS connection
   are servers that possess site certificates, mutual TLS authentication
   SHOULD occur. Each side of the connection SHOULD verify and inspect
   the certificate of the other, noting the domain name that appears in
   the certificate for comparison with the header fields of SIP
   messages. The atlanta.com proxy server, for example, SHOULD verify
   at this stage that the certificate received from the remote side
   corresponds with the biloxi.com domain.
