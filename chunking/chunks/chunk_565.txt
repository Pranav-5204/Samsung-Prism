Ensuring that TLS will be used for all of the request segments up to
   the target domain is somewhat complex. It is possible that
   cryptographically authenticated proxy servers along the way that are
   non-compliant or compromised may choose to disregard the forwarding
   rules associated with SIPS (and the general forwarding rules in
   Section 16.6). Such malicious intermediaries could, for example,
   retarget a request from a SIPS URI to a SIP URI in an attempt to
   downgrade security. Alternatively, an intermediary might legitimately retarget a request
   from a SIP to a SIPS URI. Recipients of a request whose Request-URI
   uses the SIPS URI scheme thus cannot assume on the basis of the
   Request-URI alone that SIPS was used for the entire request path
   (from the client onwards).
