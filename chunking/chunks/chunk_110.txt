This location service is effectively a database
   containing mappings between a single URI and a set of one or more
   alternative locations at which the target of that URI can be found. A redirect server does not issue any SIP requests of its own. After
   receiving a request other than CANCEL, the server either refuses the
   request or gathers the list of alternative locations from the    location service and returns a final response of class 3xx. For
   well-formed CANCEL requests, it SHOULD return a 2xx response. This
   response ends the SIP transaction. The redirect server maintains
   transaction state for an entire SIP transaction. It is the
   responsibility of clients to detect forwarding loops between redirect
   servers. When a redirect server returns a 3xx response to a request, it
   populates the list of (one or more) alternative locations into the
   Contact header field.
