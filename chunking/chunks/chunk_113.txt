This provides a modest level of backwards compatibility with RFC
      2543, which allowed absolute times in this header field. If an
      absolute time is received, it will be treated as malformed, and
      then default to 3600. Redirect servers MUST ignore features that are not understood
   (including unrecognized header fields, any unknown option tags in
   Require, or even method names) and proceed with the redirection of
   the request in question. 9 Canceling a Request
   The previous section has discussed general UA behavior for generating
   requests and processing responses for requests of all methods. In
   this section, we discuss a general purpose method, called CANCEL. The CANCEL request, as the name implies, is used to cancel a previous
   request sent by a client. Specifically, it asks the UAS to cease
   processing the request and to generate an error response to that
   request. CANCEL has no effect on a request to which a UAS has
   already given a final response.
