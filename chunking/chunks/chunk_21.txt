Alice and Bobâ€™s media session has now begun, and they send media
   packets using the format to which they agreed in the exchange of SDP. In general, the end-to-end media packets take a different path from
   the SIP signaling messages. During the session, either Alice or Bob may decide to change the
   characteristics of the media session. This is accomplished by
   sending a re-INVITE containing a new media description. This re-
   INVITE references the existing dialog so that the other party knows
   that it is to modify an existing session instead of establishing a
   new session. The other party sends a 200 (OK) to accept the change. The requestor responds to the 200 (OK) with an ACK. If the other
   party does not accept the change, he sends an error response such as
   488 (Not Acceptable Here), which also receives an ACK. However, the
   failure of the re-INVITE does not cause the existing call to fail -
   the session continues using the previously negotiated
   characteristics.
