26.3 Implementing Security Mechanisms
26.3.1 Requirements for Implementers of SIP
   Proxy servers, redirect servers, and registrars MUST implement TLS,
   and MUST support both mutual and one-way authentication. It is
   strongly RECOMMENDED that UAs be capable initiating TLS; UAs MAY also
   be capable of acting as a TLS server. Proxy servers, redirect
   servers, and registrars SHOULD possess a site certificate whose
   subject corresponds to their canonical hostname. UAs MAY have
   certificates of their own for mutual authentication with TLS, but no
   provisions are set forth in this document for their use. All SIP
   elements that support TLS MUST have a mechanism for validating
   certificates received during TLS negotiation; this entails possession
   of one or more root certificates issued by certificate authorities
   (preferably well-known distributors of site certificates comparable
   to those that issue root certificates for web browsers).
