The following examples by no means provide an exhaustive list of the
   threats against SIP; rather, these are "classic" threats that
   demonstrate the need for particular security services that can
   potentially prevent whole categories of threats. These attacks assume an environment in which attackers can
   potentially read any packet on the network - it is anticipated that
   SIP will frequently be used on the public Internet. Attackers on the
   network may be able to modify packets (perhaps at some compromised
   intermediary). Attackers may wish to steal services, eavesdrop on
   communications, or disrupt sessions. 26.1.1 Registration Hijacking
   The SIP registration mechanism allows a user agent to identify itself
   to a registrar as a device at which a user (designated by an address
   of record) is located.
