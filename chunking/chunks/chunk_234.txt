Each proxy in the path of a request chooses whether to add a
         Record-Route header field value independently - the presence of
         a Record-Route header field in a request does not obligate this
         proxy to add a value. The URI placed in the Record-Route header field value MUST be a
         SIP or SIPS URI. This URI MUST contain an lr parameter (see
         Section 19.1.1). This URI MAY be different for each
         destination the request is forwarded to. The URI SHOULD NOT
         contain the transport parameter unless the proxy has knowledge
         (such as in a private network) that the next downstream element
         that will be in the path of subsequent requests supports that
         transport. The URI this proxy provides will be used by some other element
         to make a routing decision.
