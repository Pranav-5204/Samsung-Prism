Stateless Proxy: A logical entity that does not maintain the
         client or server transaction state machines defined in this
         specification when it processes requests. A stateless proxy
         forwards every request it receives downstream and every
         response it receives upstream. Strict Routing: A proxy is said to be strict routing if it follows
         the Route processing rules of RFC 2543 and many prior work in
         progress versions of this RFC. That rule caused proxies to
         destroy the contents of the Request-URI when a Route header
         field was present. Strict routing behavior is not used in this
         specification, in favor of a loose routing behavior. Proxies
         that perform strict routing are also known as strict routers. Target Refresh Request: A target refresh request sent within a
         dialog is defined as a request that can modify the remote
         target of the dialog.
