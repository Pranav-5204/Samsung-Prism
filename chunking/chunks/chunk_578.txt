28 Changes From RFC 2543
   This RFC revises RFC 2543. It is mostly backwards compatible with
   RFC 2543. The changes described here fix many errors discovered in
   RFC 2543 and provide information on scenarios not detailed in RFC
   2543. The protocol has been presented in a more cleanly layered
   model here.
