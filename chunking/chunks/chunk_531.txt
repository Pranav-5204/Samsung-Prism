A cryptographic authentication mechanism is provided in
   SIP to address this requirement. An independent security mechanism for SIP message bodies supplies an
   alternative means of end-to-end mutual authentication, as well as
   providing a limit on the degree to which user agents must trust
   intermediaries. 26.2.1 Transport and Network Layer Security
   Transport or network layer security encrypts signaling traffic,
   guaranteeing message confidentiality and integrity. Oftentimes, certificates are used in the establishment of lower-layer
   security, and these certificates can also be used to provide a means
   of authentication in many architectures. Two popular alternatives for providing security at the transport and
   network layer are, respectively, TLS [25] and IPSec [26]. IPSec is a set of network-layer protocol tools that collectively can
   be used as a secure replacement for traditional IP (Internet
   Protocol).
