Full details on session modification are in Section
   14. At the end of the call, Bob disconnects (hangs up) first and
   generates a BYE message. This BYE is routed directly to Aliceâ€™s
   softphone, again bypassing the proxies. Alice confirms receipt of
   the BYE with a 200 (OK) response, which terminates the session and
   the BYE transaction. No ACK is sent - an ACK is only sent in
   response to a response to an INVITE request. The reasons for this
   special handling for INVITE will be discussed later, but relate to
   the reliability mechanisms in SIP, the length of time it can take for
   a ringing phone to be answered, and forking. For this reason,
   request handling in SIP is often classified as either INVITE or non-
   INVITE, referring to all other methods besides INVITE. Full details
   on session termination are in Section 15. Section 24.2 describes the messages shown in Figure 1 in full.
