If the types
   include one that can describe media capabilities, the UAS SHOULD
   include a body in the response for that purpose. Details on the
   construction of such a body in the case of application/sdp are
   described in [13]. Example OPTIONS response generated by a UAS (corresponding to the
   request in Section 11.1):
