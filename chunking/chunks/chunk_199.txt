If the session description format has the capability for version
   numbers, the offerer SHOULD indicate that the version of the session
   description has changed. The To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, and Request-URI of a re-INVITE are set
   following the same rules as for regular requests within an existing
   dialog, described in Section 12. A UAC MAY choose not to add an Alert-Info header field or a body with
   Content-Disposition "alert" to re-INVITEs because UASs do not
   typically alert the user upon reception of a re-INVITE. Unlike an INVITE, which can fork, a re-INVITE will never fork, and
   therefore, only ever generate a single final response. The reason a
   re-INVITE will never fork is that the Request-URI identifies the
   target as the UA instance it established the dialog with, rather than
   identifying an address-of-record for the user.
