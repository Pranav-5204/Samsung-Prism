The local
   tag component of the dialog ID MUST be set to the tag in the To field
   in the response to the request (which always includes a tag), and the
   remote tag component of the dialog ID MUST be set to the tag from the
   From field in the request. A UAS MUST be prepared to receive a
   request without a tag in the From field, in which case the tag is
   considered to have a value of null. This is to maintain backwards compatibility with RFC 2543, which
      did not mandate From tags. The remote URI MUST be set to the URI in the From field, and the
   local URI MUST be set to the URI in the To field. 12.1.2 UAC Behavior
   When a UAC sends a request that can establish a dialog (such as an
   INVITE) it MUST provide a SIP or SIPS URI with global scope (i.e.,
   the same SIP URI can be used in messages outside this dialog) in the
   Contact header field of the request.
