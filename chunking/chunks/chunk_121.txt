If a user wants to initiate a
   session with another user, SIP must discover the current host(s) at
   which the destination user is reachable. This discovery process is
   frequently accomplished by SIP network elements such as proxy servers
   and redirect servers which are responsible for receiving a request,
   determining where to send it based on knowledge of the location of
   the user, and then sending it there. To do this, SIP network
   elements consult an abstract service known as a location service,
   which provides address bindings for a particular domain. These
   address bindings map an incoming SIP or SIPS URI, sip:bob@biloxi.com,
   for example, to one or more URIs that are somehow "closer" to the
   desired user, sip:bob@engineering.biloxi.com, for example. Ultimately, a proxy will consult a location service that maps a
   received URI to the user agent(s) at which the desired recipient is
   currently residing.
