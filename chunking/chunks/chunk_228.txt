Allowing a URI to be added to the set only once reduces
      unnecessary network traffic, and in the case of incorporating
      contacts from redirect requests prevents infinite recursion. For example, a trivial location service is a "no-op", where the
   target URI is equal to the incoming request URI. The request is sent
   to a specific next hop proxy for further processing. During request    forwarding of Section 16.6, Item 6, the identity of that next hop,
   expressed as a SIP or SIPS URI, is inserted as the top-most Route
   header field value into the request. If the Request-URI indicates a resource at this proxy that does not
   exist, the proxy MUST return a 404 (Not Found) response. If the target set remains empty after applying all of the above, the
   proxy MUST return an error response, which SHOULD be the 480
   (Temporarily Unavailable) response. 16.6 Request Forwarding
   As soon as the target set is non-empty, a proxy MAY begin forwarding
   the request.
