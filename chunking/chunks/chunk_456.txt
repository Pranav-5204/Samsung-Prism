The following rule is RECOMMENDED for proxy credential caching:
   If a UA receives a Proxy-Authenticate header field value in a 401/407
   response to a request with a particular Call-ID, it should
   incorporate credentials for that realm in all subsequent requests
   that contain the same Call-ID. These credentials MUST NOT be cached
   across dialogs; however, if a UA is configured with the realm of its
   local outbound proxy, when one exists, then the UA MAY cache
   credentials for that realm across dialogs. Note that this does mean
   a future request in a dialog could contain credentials that are not
   needed by any proxy along the Route header path. Any UA that wishes to authenticate itself to a proxy server --
   usually, but not necessarily, after receiving a 407 (Proxy
   Authentication Required) response -- MAY do so by including a Proxy-
   Authorization header field value with the request.
