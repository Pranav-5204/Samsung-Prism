The
         userinfo part of a URI is optional and MAY be absent when the          destination host does not have a notion of users or when the
         host itself is the resource being identified. If the @ sign is
         present in a SIP or SIPS URI, the user field MUST NOT be empty. If the host being addressed can process telephone numbers, for
         instance, an Internet telephony gateway, a telephone-
         subscriber field defined in RFC 2806 [9] MAY be used to
         populate the user field. There are special escaping rules for
         encoding telephone-subscriber fields in SIP and SIPS URIs
         described in Section 19.1.2.
      password: A password associated with the user. While the SIP and
         SIPS URI syntax allows this field to be present, its use is NOT
         RECOMMENDED, because the passing of authentication information
         in clear text (such as URIs) has proven to be a security risk
         in almost every case where it has been used.
