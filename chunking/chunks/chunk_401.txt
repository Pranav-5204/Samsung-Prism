Examples:
      SIP/2.0 404 The number you have dialed is not in service
      Error-Info: <sip:not-in-service-recording@atlanta.com>
20.19 Expires
   The Expires header field gives the relative time after which the
   message (or content) expires. The precise meaning of this is method dependent. The expiration time in an INVITE does not affect the duration of the
   actual session that may result from the invitation. Session
   description protocols may offer the ability to express time limits on
   the session duration, however. The value of this field is an integral number of seconds (in decimal)
   between 0 and (2**32)-1, measured from the receipt of the request. Example:
      Expires: 5
20.20 From
   The From header field indicates the initiator of the request. This
   may be different from the initiator of the dialog. Requests sent by
   the callee to the caller use the calleeâ€™s address in the From header
   field.
