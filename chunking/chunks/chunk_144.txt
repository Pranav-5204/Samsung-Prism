It then skips the remaining steps. Allowing the registrar to set the registration interval
         protects it against excessively frequent registration refreshes
         while limiting the state that it needs to maintain and
         decreasing the likelihood of registrations going stale. The
         expiration interval of a registration is frequently used in the
         creation of services. An example is a follow-me service, where
         the user may only be available at a terminal for a brief
         period. Therefore, registrars should accept brief
         registrations; a request should only be rejected if the
         interval is so short that the refreshes would degrade registrar
         performance. For each address, the registrar then searches the list of
         current bindings using the URI comparison rules. If the
         binding does not exist, it is tentatively added. If the
         binding does exist, the registrar checks the Call-ID value.
