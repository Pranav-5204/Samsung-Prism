If that URI does not
         contain an lr parameter, the proxy MUST modify the copy as
         follows:
         -  The proxy MUST place the Request-URI into the Route header
            field as the last value. -  The proxy MUST then place the first Route header field value
            into the Request-URI and remove that value from the Route
            header field. Appending the Request-URI to the Route header field is part of
         a mechanism used to pass the information in that Request-URI
         through strict-routing elements. "Popping" the first Route
         header field value into the Request-URI formats the message the
         way a strict-routing element expects to receive it (with its
         own URI in the Request-URI and the next location to visit in
         the first Route header field value). 7.
