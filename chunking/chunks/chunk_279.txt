The proxy will inspect the URI in the topmost Route header
          field value. If it indicates this proxy, the proxy removes it
          from the Route header field (this route node has been
          reached). 3. The proxy will forward the request to the resource indicated
          by the URI in the topmost Route header field value or in the
          Request-URI if no Route header field is present. The proxy
          determines the address, port and transport to use when
          forwarding the request by applying the procedures in [4] to
          that URI. If no strict-routing elements are encountered on the path of the
   request, the Request-URI will always indicate the target of the
   request. 16.12.1 Examples
16.12.1.1 Basic SIP Trapezoid
   This scenario is the basic SIP trapezoid, U1 -> P1 -> P2 -> U2, with
   both proxies record-routing. Here is the flow. U1 sends:
      INVITE sip:callee@domain.com SIP/2.0
      Contact: sip:caller@u1.example.com
   to P1.
