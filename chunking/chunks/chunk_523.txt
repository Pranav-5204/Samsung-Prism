Worse yet, if the proxy
   server were actively malicious, it could modify the session key,
   either acting as a man-in-the-middle, or perhaps changing the
   security characteristics requested by the originating UA. This family of threats applies not only to session keys, but to most
   conceivable forms of content carried end-to-end in SIP. These might
   include MIME bodies that should be rendered to the user, SDP, or
   encapsulated telephony signals, among others. Attackers might
   attempt to modify SDP bodies, for example, in order to point RTP
   media streams to a wiretapping device in order to eavesdrop on
   subsequent voice communications. Also note that some header fields in SIP are meaningful end-to-end,
   for example, Subject. UAs might be protective of these header fields
   as well as bodies (a malicious intermediary changing the Subject
   header field might make an important request appear to be spam, for
   example).
