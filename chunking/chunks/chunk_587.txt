This was changed to MUST. This is important, since many subsequent features depend on
      delivery of all provisional responses from 101 to 199.
   o  Little was said about the 503 response code in RFC 2543. It has
      since found substantial use in indicating failure or overload
      conditions in proxies. This requires somewhat special treatment. Specifically, receipt of a 503 should trigger an attempt to
      contact the next element in the result of a DNS SRV lookup. Also,
      503 response is only forwarded upstream by a proxy under certain
      conditions. o  RFC 2543 defined, but did no sufficiently specify, a mechanism for
      UA authentication of a server. That has been removed. Instead,
      the mutual authentication procedures of RFC 2617 are allowed. o  A UA cannot send a BYE for a call until it has received an ACK for
      the initial INVITE. This was allowed in RFC 2543 but leads to a
      potential race condition.
