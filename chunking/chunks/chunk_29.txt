The layer above the transaction layer is called the transaction user
   (TU). Each of the SIP entities, except the stateless proxy, is a
   transaction user. When a TU wishes to send a request, it creates a
   client transaction instance and passes it the request along with the
   destination IP address, port, and transport to which to send the
   request. A TU that creates a client transaction can also cancel it. When a client cancels a transaction, it requests that the server stop
   further processing, revert to the state that existed before the
   transaction was initiated, and generate a specific error response to
   that transaction. This is done with a CANCEL request, which
   constitutes its own transaction, but references the transaction to be
   cancelled (Section 9). The SIP elements, that is, user agent clients and servers, stateless
   and stateful proxies and registrars, contain a core that
   distinguishes them from each other.
