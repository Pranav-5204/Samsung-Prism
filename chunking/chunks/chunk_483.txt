The rules for handling any such
   differences for all of the header fields described in this document
   are given in this section. Note that for the purposes of loose timestamping, all SIP messages
   that tunnel "message/sip" SHOULD contain a Date header in both the
   "inner" and "outer" headers. 23.4.1.1 Integrity
   Whenever integrity checks are performed, the integrity of a header
   field should be determined by matching the value of the header field
   in the signed body with that in the "outer" messages using the
   comparison rules of SIP as described in 20. Header fields that can be legitimately modified by proxy servers are:
   Request-URI, Via, Record-Route, Route, Max-Forwards, and Proxy-
   Authorization. If these header fields are not intact end-to-end,
   implementations SHOULD NOT consider this a breach of security. Changes to any other header fields defined in this document
   constitute an integrity violation; users MUST be notified of a
   discrepancy.
