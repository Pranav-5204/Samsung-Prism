The initial state, "calling", MUST be entered when the TU
   initiates a new client transaction with an INVITE request. The
   client transaction MUST pass the request to the transport layer for
   transmission (see Section 18). If an unreliable transport is being
   used, the client transaction MUST start timer A with a value of T1. If a reliable transport is being used, the client transaction SHOULD
   NOT start timer A (Timer A controls request retransmissions). For
   any transport, the client transaction MUST start timer B with a value
   of 64*T1 seconds (Timer B controls transaction timeouts). When timer A fires, the client transaction MUST retransmit the
   request by passing it to the transport layer, and MUST reset the
   timer with a value of 2*T1. The formal definition of retransmit    within the context of the transaction layer is to take the message
   previously sent to the transport layer and pass it to the transport
   layer once more.
