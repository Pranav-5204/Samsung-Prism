Therefore, the branch parameter
   will be unique across all transactions sent by that client. The
   request matches a transaction if:
      1. the branch parameter in the request is equal to the one in the
         top Via header field of the request that created the
         transaction, and
      2. the sent-by value in the top Via of the request is equal to the
         one in the request that created the transaction, and
      3. the method of the request matches the one that created the
         transaction, except for ACK, where the method of the request
         that created the transaction is INVITE. This matching rule applies to both INVITE and non-INVITE transactions
   alike. The sent-by value is used as part of the matching process because
      there could be accidental or malicious duplication of branch
      parameters from different clients.
