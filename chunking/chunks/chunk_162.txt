12.2 Requests within a Dialog
   Once a dialog has been established between two UAs, either of them
   MAY initiate new transactions as needed within the dialog. The UA
   sending the request will take the UAC role for the transaction. The
   UA receiving the request will take the UAS role. Note that these may
   be different roles than the UAs held during the transaction that
   established the dialog. Requests within a dialog MAY contain Record-Route and Contact header
   fields. However, these requests do not cause the dialog’s route set
   to be modified, although they may modify the remote target URI. Specifically, requests that are not target refresh requests do not
   modify the dialog’s remote target URI, and requests that are target
   refresh requests do. For dialogs that have been established with an    INVITE, the only target refresh request defined is re-INVITE (see
   Section 14).
