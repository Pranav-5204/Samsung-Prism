4xx,
   5xx and 6xx responses may contain a Contact header field value
   indicating the location where additional information about the error
   can be found. Subsequent final responses (which would only arrive
   under error conditions) MUST be ignored. All early dialogs are considered terminated upon reception of the
   non-2xx final response. After having received the non-2xx final response the UAC core
   considers the INVITE transaction completed. The INVITE client
   transaction handles the generation of ACKs for the response (see
   Section 17). 13.2.2.4 2xx Responses
   Multiple 2xx responses may arrive at the UAC for a single INVITE
   request due to a forking proxy. Each response is distinguished by
   the tag parameter in the To header field, and each represents a
   distinct dialog, with a distinct dialog identifier.
