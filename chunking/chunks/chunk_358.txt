Even without this
         parameter, recipients of SIP and SIPS URIs MAY interpret the
         pre-@ part as a telephone number if local restrictions on the
         name space for user name allow it. The method of the SIP request constructed from the URI can be
         specified with the method parameter. The lr parameter, when present, indicates that the element
         responsible for this resource implements the routing mechanisms
         specified in this document. This parameter will be used in the
         URIs proxies place into Record-Route header field values, and
         may appear in the URIs in a pre-existing route set. This parameter is used to achieve backwards compatibility with
         systems implementing the strict-routing mechanisms of RFC 2543
         and the rfc2543bis drafts up to bis-05.
