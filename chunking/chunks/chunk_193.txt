To prevent cancellation, the UAS MUST send a non-100
   provisional response at every minute, to handle the possibility of
   lost provisional responses. An INVITE transaction can go on for extended durations when the
      user is placed on hold, or when interworking with PSTN systems
      which allow communications to take place without answering the
      call. The latter is common in Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
      systems. 13.3.1.2 The INVITE is Redirected
   If the UAS decides to redirect the call, a 3xx response is sent. A
   300 (Multiple Choices), 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved
   Temporarily) response SHOULD contain a Contact header field    containing one or more URIs of new addresses to be tried. The
   response is passed to the INVITE server transaction, which will deal
   with its retransmissions. 13.3.1.3 The INVITE is Rejected
   A common scenario occurs when the callee is currently not willing or
   able to take additional calls at this end system.
