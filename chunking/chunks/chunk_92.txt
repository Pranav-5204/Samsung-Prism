It is RECOMMENDED that the UAC reuse the same To, From, and Call-ID
   used in the original redirected request, but the UAC MAY also choose
   to update the Call-ID header field value for new requests, for
   example. Finally, once the new request has been constructed, it is sent using
   a new client transaction, and therefore MUST have a new branch ID in
   the top Via field as discussed in Section 8.1.1.7. In all other respects, requests sent upon receipt of a redirect
   response SHOULD re-use the header fields and bodies of the original
   request. In some instances, Contact header field values may be cached at UAC
   temporarily or permanently depending on the status code received and
   the presence of an expiration interval; see Sections 21.3.2 and
   21.3.3. 8.1.3.5 Processing 4xx Responses
   Certain 4xx response codes require specific UA processing,
   independent of the method.
