SIP access
   authentication is explained in Sections 26 and 22.3. This status code can be used for applications where access to the
   communication channel (for example, a telephony gateway) rather than
   the callee requires authentication. 21.4.9 408 Request Timeout
   The server could not produce a response within a suitable amount of
   time, for example, if it could not determine the location of the user
   in time. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at
   any later time. 21.4.10 410 Gone
   The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no
   forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be
   considered permanent. If the server does not know, or has no
   facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the
   status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead.
