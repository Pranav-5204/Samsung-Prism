A registrar assesses the identity asserted in
   the From header field of a REGISTER message to determine whether this
   request can modify the contact addresses associated with the
   address-of-record in the To header field. While these two fields are
   frequently the same, there are many valid deployments in which a
   third-party may register contacts on a user’s behalf. The From header field of a SIP request, however, can be modified
   arbitrarily by the owner of a UA, and this opens the door to
   malicious registrations. An attacker that successfully impersonates
   a party authorized to change contacts associated with an address-of-
   record could, for example, de-register all existing contacts for a
   URI and then register their own device as the appropriate contact
   address, thereby directing all requests for the affected user to the
   attacker’s device.
