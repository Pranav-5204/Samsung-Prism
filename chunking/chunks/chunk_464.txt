Therefore, any
          algorithms that have a dependency on the cnonce (including
          "MD5-Sess") require that the qop directive be sent. Use of
          the "qop" parameter is optional in RFC 2617 for the purposes
          of backwards compatibility with RFC 2069; since RFC 2543 was
          based on RFC 2069, the "qop" parameter must unfortunately
          remain optional for clients and servers to receive. However,
          servers MUST always send a "qop" parameter in WWW-Authenticate
          and Proxy-Authenticate header field values. If a client
          receives a "qop" parameter in a challenge header field, it
          MUST send the "qop" parameter in any resulting authorization
          header field. RFC 2543 did not allow usage of the Authentication-Info header field
   (it effectively used RFC 2069). However, we now allow usage of this
   header field, since it provides integrity checks over the bodies and
   provides mutual authentication.
