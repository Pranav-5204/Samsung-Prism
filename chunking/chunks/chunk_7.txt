Figure 1 shows a typical example of a SIP message exchange between
   two users, Alice and Bob. (Each message is labeled with the letter
   "F" and a number for reference by the text.) In this example, Alice
   uses a SIP application on her PC (referred to as a softphone) to call
   Bob on his SIP phone over the Internet. Also shown are two SIP proxy
   servers that act on behalf of Alice and Bob to facilitate the session
   establishment. This typical arrangement is often referred to as the
   "SIP trapezoid" as shown by the geometric shape of the dotted lines
   in Figure 1. Alice "calls" Bob using his SIP identity, a type of Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) called a SIP URI. SIP URIs are defined in Section
   19.1. It has a similar form to an email address, typically
   containing a username and a host name. In this case, it is
   sip:bob@biloxi.com, where biloxi.com is the domain of Bobâ€™s SIP
   service provider. Alice has a SIP URI of sip:alice@atlanta.com.
