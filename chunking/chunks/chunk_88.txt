If a client wishes to formulate
   new requests based on a 3xx class response to that request, it places
   the URIs to try into the target set. Subject to the restrictions in
   this specification, a client can choose which Contact URIs it places
   into the target set. As with proxy recursion, a client processing
   3xx class responses MUST NOT add any given URI to the target set more
   than once. If the original request had a SIPS URI in the Request-
   URI, the client MAY choose to recurse to a non-SIPS URI, but SHOULD
   inform the user of the redirection to an insecure URI. Any new request may receive 3xx responses themselves containing
      the original URI as a contact. Two locations can be configured to
      redirect to each other. Placing any given URI in the target set
      only once prevents infinite redirection loops. As the target set grows, the client MAY generate new requests to the
   URIs in any order.
