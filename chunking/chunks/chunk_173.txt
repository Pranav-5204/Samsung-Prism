If the remote sequence number was not empty, but the sequence number
   of the request is lower than the remote sequence number, the request
   is out of order and MUST be rejected with a 500 (Server Internal
   Error) response. If the remote sequence number was not empty, and
   the sequence number of the request is greater than the remote
   sequence number, the request is in order. It is possible for the
   CSeq sequence number to be higher than the remote sequence number by
   more than one. This is not an error condition, and a UAS SHOULD be
   prepared to receive and process requests with CSeq values more than
   one higher than the previous received request. The UAS MUST then set
   the remote sequence number to the value of the sequence number in the
   CSeq header field value in the request. If a proxy challenges a request generated by the UAC, the UAC has
      to resubmit the request with credentials. The resubmitted request
      will have a new CSeq number.
