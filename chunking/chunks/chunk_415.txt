Example:
      User-Agent: Softphone Beta1.5
20.42 Via
   The Via header field indicates the path taken by the request so far
   and indicates the path that should be followed in routing responses. The branch ID parameter in the Via header field values serves as a
   transaction identifier, and is used by proxies to detect loops. A Via header field value contains the transport protocol used to send
   the message, the clientâ€™s host name or network address, and possibly
   the port number at which it wishes to receive responses. A Via
   header field value can also contain parameters such as "maddr",
   "ttl", "received", and "branch", whose meaning and use are described    in other sections. For implementations compliant to this
   specification, the value of the branch parameter MUST start with the
   magic cookie "z9hG4bK", as discussed in Section 8.1.1.7. Transport protocols defined here are "UDP", "TCP", "TLS", and "SCTP". "TLS" means TLS over TCP.
