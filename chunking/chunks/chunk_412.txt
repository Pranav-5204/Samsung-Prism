Implementers SHOULD make the Server
   header field a configurable option. Example:
      Server: HomeServer v2
20.36 Subject
   The Subject header field provides a summary or indicates the nature
   of the call, allowing call filtering without having to parse the
   session description. The session description does not have to use
   the same subject indication as the invitation. The compact form of the Subject header field is s.    Example:
      Subject: Need more boxes
      s: Tech Support
20.37 Supported
   The Supported header field enumerates all the extensions supported by
   the UAC or UAS. The Supported header field contains a list of option tags, described
   in Section 19.2, that are understood by the UAC or UAS. A UA
   compliant to this specification MUST only include option tags
   corresponding to standards-track RFCs. If empty, it means that no
   extensions are supported.
