A first digit of "3"
   indicates warnings specific to SIP. Until a future specification
   describes uses of warn-codes other than 3xx, only 3xx warn-codes may
   be registered. Warnings 300 through 329 are reserved for indicating problems with
   keywords in the session description, 330 through 339 are warnings
   related to basic network services requested in the session
   description, 370 through 379 are warnings related to quantitative QoS
   parameters requested in the session description, and 390 through 399
   are miscellaneous warnings that do not fall into one of the above
   categories. 27.3 Header Field Names
   This obsoletes the IANA instructions about the header sub-registry
