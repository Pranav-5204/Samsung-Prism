A common mechanism is to order the set by the "q"
   parameter value from the Contact header field value. Requests to the
   URIs MAY be generated serially or in parallel. One approach is to
   process groups of decreasing q-values serially and process the URIs
   in each q-value group in parallel. Another is to perform only serial
   processing in decreasing q-value order, arbitrarily choosing between
   contacts of equal q-value. If contacting an address in the list results in a failure, as defined
   in the next paragraph, the element moves to the next address in the
   list, until the list is exhausted. If the list is exhausted, then
   the request has failed. Failures SHOULD be detected through failure response codes (codes
   greater than 399); for network errors the client transaction will
   report any transport layer failures to the transaction user.
