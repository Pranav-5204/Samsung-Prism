The escaping rules defined above allow a
   semicolon to appear unescaped in this field. For the purposes of
   this protocol, the field is opaque. The structure of that value is
   only useful to the SIP element responsible for the resource. 19.1.4 URI Comparison
   Some operations in this specification require determining whether two
   SIP or SIPS URIs are equivalent. In this specification, registrars
   need to compare bindings in Contact URIs in REGISTER requests (see
   Section 10.3.). SIP and SIPS URIs are compared for equality
   according to the following rules:
      o  A SIP and SIPS URI are never equivalent. o  Comparison of the userinfo of SIP and SIPS URIs is case-
         sensitive. This includes userinfo containing passwords or
         formatted as telephone-subscribers. Comparison of all other
         components of the URI is case-insensitive unless explicitly
         defined otherwise.
