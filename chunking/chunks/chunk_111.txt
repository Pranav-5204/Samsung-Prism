An "expires" parameter to the Contact header
   field values may also be supplied to indicate the lifetime of the
   Contact data. The Contact header field contains URIs giving the new locations or
   user names to try, or may simply specify additional transport
   parameters. A 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved Temporarily)
   response may also give the same location and username that was
   targeted by the initial request but specify additional transport
   parameters such as a different server or multicast address to try, or
   a change of SIP transport from UDP to TCP or vice versa. However, redirect servers MUST NOT redirect a request to a URI equal
   to the one in the Request-URI; instead, provided that the URI does
   not point to itself, the server MAY proxy the request to the
   destination URI, or MAY reject it with a 404. If a client is using an outbound proxy, and that proxy actually
      redirects requests, a potential arises for infinite redirection
      loops.
