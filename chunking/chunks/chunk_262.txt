Aggregate Authorization Header Field Values
         If the selected response is a 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy
         Authentication Required), the proxy MUST collect any WWW-
         Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate header field values from
         all other 401 (Unauthorized) and 407 (Proxy Authentication
         Required) responses received so far in this response context
         and add them to this response without modification before
         forwarding. The resulting 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy
         Authentication Required) response could have several WWW-
         Authenticate AND Proxy-Authenticate header field values. This is necessary because any or all of the destinations the
         request was forwarded to may have requested credentials. The
         client needs to receive all of those challenges and supply
         credentials for each of them when it retries the request. Motivation for this behavior is provided in Section 26. 8.
