These
      include, but are not limited to, syntax error in header fields,
      invalid combinations of URI parameters, or an incorrect
      description of the message body. Sending a request formed from a given URI may require capabilities
   unavailable to the implementation. The URI might indicate use of an
   unimplemented transport or extension, for example. An implementation
   SHOULD refuse to send these requests rather than modifying them to
   match their capabilities. An implementation MUST NOT send a request
   requiring an extension that it does not support. For example, such a request can be formed through the presence of
      a Require header parameter or a method URI parameter with an
      unknown or explicitly unsupported value.
