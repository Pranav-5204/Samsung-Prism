The Require header field contains a list of option tags, described in
   Section 19.2. Each option tag defines a SIP extension that MUST be
   understood to process the request. Frequently, this is used to
   indicate that a specific set of extension header fields need to be
   understood. A UAC compliant to this specification MUST only include
   option tags corresponding to standards-track RFCs. Example:
      Require: 100rel
20.33 Retry-After
   The Retry-After header field can be used with a 500 (Server Internal
   Error) or 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the
   service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client and
   with a 404 (Not Found), 413 (Request Entity Too Large), 480
   (Temporarily Unavailable), 486 (Busy Here), 600 (Busy), or 603    (Decline) response to indicate when the called party anticipates
   being available again. The value of this field is a positive integer
   number of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the response.
