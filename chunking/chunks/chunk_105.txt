Once all procedures associated with the creation of a response have
   been completed, the UAS hands the response back to the server
   transaction from which it received the request. 8.2.6.1 Sending a Provisional Response
   One largely non-method-specific guideline for the generation of
   responses is that UASs SHOULD NOT issue a provisional response for a
   non-INVITE request. Rather, UASs SHOULD generate a final response to
   a non-INVITE request as soon as possible. When a 100 (Trying) response is generated, any Timestamp header field
   present in the request MUST be copied into this 100 (Trying)
   response. If there is a delay in generating the response, the UAS
   SHOULD add a delay value into the Timestamp value in the response. This value MUST contain the difference between the time of sending of
   the response and receipt of the request, measured in seconds. 8.2.6.2 Headers and Tags
   The From field of the response MUST equal the From header field of
   the request.
