Maintaining redundancy of
   long-lived TLS connections, especially when a UA is solely
   responsible for their establishment, could also be cumbersome. TLS only allows SIP entities to authenticate servers to which they
   are adjacent; TLS offers strictly hop-by-hop security. Neither TLS,
   nor any other mechanism specified in this document, allows clients to
   authenticate proxy servers to whom they cannot form a direct TCP
   connection. 26.4.4 SIPS URIs
   Actually using TLS on every segment of a request path entails that
   the terminating UAS must be reachable over TLS (perhaps registering
   with a SIPS URI as a contact address). This is the preferred use of
   SIPS. Many valid architectures, however, use TLS to secure part of
   the request path, but rely on some other mechanism for the final hop
   to a UAS, for example. Thus SIPS cannot guarantee that TLS usage
   will be truly end-to-end.
