This usually means at least 64*T1 (see Section 17.1.1.1 for a
   definition of T1). However, it could be larger in an element that
   has a TU using a large value for timer C (bullet 11 of Section 16.6),
   for example. All SIP elements MUST implement UDP and TCP. SIP elements MAY
   implement other protocols. Making TCP mandatory for the UA is a substantial change from RFC
      2543. It has arisen out of the need to handle larger messages,
      which MUST use TCP, as discussed below. Thus, even if an element
      never sends large messages, it may receive one and needs to be
      able to handle them. 18.1 Clients
18.1.1 Sending Requests
   The client side of the transport layer is responsible for sending the
   request and receiving responses. The user of the transport layer
   passes the client transport the request, an IP address, port,
   transport, and possibly TTL for multicast destinations.
