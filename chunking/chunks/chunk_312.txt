Once the client transaction enters the "Completed" state, it MUST set
   Timer K to fire in T4 seconds for unreliable transports, and zero
   seconds for reliable transports. The "Completed" state exists to
   buffer any additional response retransmissions that may be received
   (which is why the client transaction remains there only for    unreliable transports). T4 represents the amount of time the network
   will take to clear messages between client and server transactions. The default value of T4 is 5s. A response is a retransmission when
   it matches the same transaction, using the rules specified in Section
   17.1.3. If Timer K fires while in this state, the client transaction
   MUST transition to the "Terminated" state. Once the transaction is in the terminated state, it MUST be destroyed
   immediately.
