It caused interoperability problems in elements
      that were not time synchronized, a common occurrence. Relative
      times are used instead. o  The branch parameter of the Via header field value is now
      mandatory for all elements to use. It now plays the role of a
      unique transaction identifier. This avoids the complex and bug-
      laden transaction identification rules from RFC 2543. A magic
      cookie is used in the parameter value to determine if the previous
      hop has made the parameter globally unique, and comparison falls
      back to the old rules when it is not present. Thus,
      interoperability is assured. o  In RFC 2543, closure of a TCP connection was made equivalent to a
      CANCEL. This was nearly impossible to implement (and wrong) for
      TCP connections between proxies. This has been eliminated, so
      that there is no coupling between TCP connection state and SIP
      processing.
