Including these header fields allows the UAC to determine the
   features and extensions supported by the UAS for the duration of the
   call, without probing. If the INVITE request contained an offer, and the UAS had not yet
   sent an answer, the 2xx MUST contain an answer. If the INVITE did
   not contain an offer, the 2xx MUST contain an offer if the UAS had
   not yet sent an offer. Once the response has been constructed, it is passed to the INVITE
   server transaction. Note, however, that the INVITE server
   transaction will be destroyed as soon as it receives this final
   response and passes it to the transport. Therefore, it is necessary
   to periodically pass the response directly to the transport until the
   ACK arrives. The 2xx response is passed to the transport with an
   interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles for each
   retransmission until it reaches T2 seconds (T1 and T2 are defined in
   Section 17).
