The procedures in Section 8.1.2 will normally result in the
      request being sent to the address indicated by the topmost Route
      header field value or the Request-URI if no Route header field is
      present. Subject to certain restrictions, they allow the request
      to be sent to an alternate address (such as a default outbound
      proxy not represented in the route set). 12.2.1.2 Processing the Responses
   The UAC will receive responses to the request from the transaction
   layer. If the client transaction returns a timeout, this is treated
   as a 408 (Request Timeout) response. The behavior of a UAC that receives a 3xx response for a request sent
   within a dialog is the same as if the request had been sent outside a
   dialog. This behavior is described in Section 8.1.3.4. Note, however, that when the UAC tries alternative locations, it
      still uses the route set for the dialog to build the Route header
      of the request.
