The forwarded response MUST be processed as described in steps
         "Aggregate Authorization Header Field Values" through "Record-
         Route". For example, if a proxy forwarded a request to 4 locations, and
         received 503, 407, 501, and 404 responses, it may choose to
         forward the 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. 1xx and 2xx responses may be involved in the establishment of
         dialogs. When a request does not contain a To tag, the To tag
         in the response is used by the UAC to distinguish multiple
         responses to a dialog creating request. A proxy MUST NOT
         insert a tag into the To header field of a 1xx or 2xx response
         if the request did not contain one. A proxy MUST NOT modify
         the tag in the To header field of a 1xx or 2xx response.
