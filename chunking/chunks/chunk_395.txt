The
   value "alert" indicates that the body part contains information, such
   as an audio clip, that should be rendered by the user agent in an
   attempt to alert the user to the receipt of a request, generally a
   request that initiates a dialog; this alerting body could for example
   be rendered as a ring tone for a phone call after a 180 Ringing
   provisional response has been sent. Any MIME body with a "disposition-type" that renders content to the
   user should only be processed when a message has been properly
   authenticated. The handling parameter, handling-param, describes how the UAS should
   react if it receives a message body whose content type or disposition
   type it does not understand. The parameter has defined values of
   "optional" and "required". If the handling parameter is missing, the
   value "required" SHOULD be assumed. The handling parameter is
   described in RFC 3204 [19].
