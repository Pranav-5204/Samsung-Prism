Examples of servers are proxies, user agent servers,
         redirect servers, and registrars. Sequential Search: In a sequential search, a proxy server attempts
         each contact address in sequence, proceeding to the next one
         only after the previous has generated a final response. A 2xx
         or 6xx class final response always terminates a sequential
         search. Session: From the SDP specification: "A multimedia session is a
         set of multimedia senders and receivers and the data streams
         flowing from senders to receivers. A multimedia conference is
         an example of a multimedia session." (RFC 2327 [1]) (A session
         as defined for SDP can comprise one or more RTP sessions.) As
         defined, a callee can be invited several times, by different
         calls, to the same session.
