When a request is sent to a SIPS URI, the
   protocol still indicates "SIP", and the transport protocol is TLS. Via: SIP/2.0/UDP erlang.bell-telephone.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bK87asdks7
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060 ;received=192.0.2.207
     ;branch=z9hG4bK77asjd
   The compact form of the Via header field is v.
   In this example, the message originated from a multi-homed host with
   two addresses, 192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.207. The sender guessed wrong
   as to which network interface would be used. Erlang.bell-
   telephone.com noticed the mismatch and added a parameter to the
   previous hopâ€™s Via header field value, containing the address that
   the packet actually came from. The host or network address and port number are not required to
   follow the SIP URI syntax.
