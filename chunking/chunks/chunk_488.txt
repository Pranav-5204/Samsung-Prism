If the recipient
   of the signed MIME body has some stronger incentive to trust the
   certificate (they were able to validate it, they acquired it from a
   trusted repository, or they have used it frequently) then the
   signature can be taken as a stronger assertion of the identity of the
   subject of the certificate. In order to eliminate possible confusions about the addition or
   subtraction of entire header fields, senders SHOULD replicate all
   header fields from the request within the signed body. Any message
   bodies that require integrity protection MUST be attached to the
   "inner" message. If a Date header is present in a message with a signed body, the
   recipient SHOULD compare the header field value with its own internal
   clock, if applicable. If a significant time discrepancy is detected
   (on the order of an hour or more), the user agent SHOULD alert the
   user to the anomaly, and note that it is a potential security breach.
