A stateful proxy MAY process the set in any order. It
   MAY process multiple targets serially, allowing each client
   transaction to complete before starting the next. It MAY start
   client transactions with every target in parallel. It also MAY
   arbitrarily divide the set into groups, processing the groups
   serially and processing the targets in each group in parallel. A common ordering mechanism is to use the qvalue parameter of targets
   obtained from Contact header fields (see Section 20.10). Targets are
   processed from highest qvalue to lowest. Targets with equal qvalues
   may be processed in parallel. A stateful proxy must have a mechanism to maintain the target set as
   responses are received and associate the responses to each forwarded
   request with the original request. For the purposes of this model,
   this mechanism is a "response context" created by the proxy layer
   before forwarding the first request.
