Attackers can create bogus requests that contain a falsified source
   IP address and a corresponding Via header field that identify a
   targeted host as the originator of the request and then send this
   request to a large number of SIP network elements, thereby using
   hapless SIP UAs or proxies to generate denial-of-service traffic
   aimed at the target. Similarly, attackers might use falsified Route header field values in
   a request that identify the target host and then send such messages
   to forking proxies that will amplify messaging sent to the target. Record-Route could be used to similar effect when the attacker is
   certain that the SIP dialog initiated by the request will result in
   numerous transactions originating in the backwards direction. A number of denial-of-service attacks open up if REGISTER requests
   are not properly authenticated and authorized by registrars.
