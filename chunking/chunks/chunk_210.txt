A UAS core receiving a BYE request for an existing dialog MUST follow
   the procedures of Section 12.2.2 to process the request. Once done,
   the UAS SHOULD terminate the session (and therefore stop sending and
   listening for media). The only case where it can elect not to are
   multicast sessions, where participation is possible even if the other
   participant in the dialog has terminated its involvement in the
   session. Whether or not it ends its participation on the session,
   the UAS core MUST generate a 2xx response to the BYE, and MUST pass
   that to the server transaction for transmission. The UAS MUST still respond to any pending requests received for that
   dialog. It is RECOMMENDED that a 487 (Request Terminated) response
   be generated to those pending requests. 16 Proxy Behavior
16.1 Overview
   SIP proxies are elements that route SIP requests to user agent
   servers and SIP responses to user agent clients.
