A dialog ID is also associated with all responses and with any
   request that contains a tag in the To field. The rules for computing
   the dialog ID of a message depend on whether the SIP element is a UAC
   or UAS. For a UAC, the Call-ID value of the dialog ID is set to the
   Call-ID of the message, the remote tag is set to the tag in the To
   field of the message, and the local tag is set to the tag in the From    field of the message (these rules apply to both requests and
   responses). As one would expect for a UAS, the Call-ID value of the
   dialog ID is set to the Call-ID of the message, the remote tag is set
   to the tag in the From field of the message, and the local tag is set
   to the tag in the To field of the message. A dialog contains certain pieces of state needed for further message
   transmissions within the dialog.
