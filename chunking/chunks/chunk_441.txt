21.5.7 513 Message Too Large
   The server was unable to process the request since the message length
   exceeded its capabilities. 21.6 Global Failures 6xx
   6xx responses indicate that a server has definitive information about
   a particular user, not just the particular instance indicated in the
   Request-URI. 21.6.1 600 Busy Everywhere
   The calleeâ€™s end system was contacted successfully but the callee is
   busy and does not wish to take the call at this time. The response
   MAY indicate a better time to call in the Retry-After header field. If the callee does not wish to reveal the reason for declining the
   call, the callee uses status code 603 (Decline) instead. This status
   response is returned only if the client knows that no other end point
   (such as a voice mail system) will answer the request. Otherwise,
   486 (Busy Here) should be returned.
