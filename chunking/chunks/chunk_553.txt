However, Carol has no means of proving    her identity to the biloxi proxy, but she does have a CMS-detached
   signature over a "message/sip" body in the INVITE. It is unlikely in
   this instance that Carol would have any credentials in the biloxi.com
   realm, since she has no formal association with biloxi.com. The
   biloxi proxy MAY also have a strict policy that precludes it from
   even bothering to challenge requests that do not have biloxi.com in
   the "domainname" portion of the From header field - it treats these
   users as unauthenticated. The biloxi proxy has a policy for Bob that all non-authenticated
   requests should be redirected to the appropriate contact address
   registered against ’bob@biloxi.com’, namely <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>. Carol receives the redirection response over the TLS connection she
   established with the biloxi proxy, so she trusts the veracity of the
   contact address.
