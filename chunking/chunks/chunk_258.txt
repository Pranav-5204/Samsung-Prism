If no 6xx class
         responses are present, the proxy SHOULD choose from the lowest
         response class stored in the response context. The proxy MAY
         select any response within that chosen class. The proxy SHOULD          give preference to responses that provide information affecting
         resubmission of this request, such as 401, 407, 415, 420, and
         484 if the 4xx class is chosen. A proxy which receives a 503 (Service Unavailable) response
         SHOULD NOT forward it upstream unless it can determine that any
         subsequent requests it might proxy will also generate a 503. In other words, forwarding a 503 means that the proxy knows it
         cannot service any requests, not just the one for the Request-
         URI in the request which generated the 503. If the only
         response that was received is a 503, the proxy SHOULD generate
         a 500 response and forward that upstream.
