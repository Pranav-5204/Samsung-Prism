The Priority header field describes the
   priority that the SIP request should have to the receiving human or
   its agent. For example, it may be factored into decisions about call
   routing and acceptance. For these decisions, a message containing no
   Priority header field SHOULD be treated as if it specified a Priority
   of "normal". The Priority header field does not influence the use of
   communications resources such as packet forwarding priority in
   routers or access to circuits in PSTN gateways. The header field can
   have the values "non-urgent", "normal", "urgent", and "emergency",
   but additional values can be defined elsewhere. It is RECOMMENDED
   that the value of "emergency" only be used when life, limb, or
   property are in imminent danger. Otherwise, there are no semantics
   defined for this header field. These are the values of RFC 2076 [38], with the addition of
      "emergency". Examples:
      Subject: A tornado is heading our way!
