8.2.2.1 To and Request-URI
   The To header field identifies the original recipient of the request
   designated by the user identified in the From field. The original
   recipient may or may not be the UAS processing the request, due to
   call forwarding or other proxy operations. A UAS MAY apply any
   policy it wishes to determine whether to accept requests when the To    header field is not the identity of the UAS. However, it is
   RECOMMENDED that a UAS accept requests even if they do not recognize
   the URI scheme (for example, a tel: URI) in the To header field, or
   if the To header field does not address a known or current user of
   this UAS. If, on the other hand, the UAS decides to reject the
   request, it SHOULD generate a response with a 403 (Forbidden) status
   code and pass it to the server transaction for transmission. However, the Request-URI identifies the UAS that is to process the
   request.
