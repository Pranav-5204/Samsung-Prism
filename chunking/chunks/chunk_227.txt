If the proxy is not
      responsible for that URI, it will not recurse on 3xx or 416
      responses as described below. If the Request-URI of the original request indicates a resource this
   proxy is responsible for, the proxy MAY continue to add targets to
   the set after beginning Request Forwarding. It MAY use any
   information obtained during that processing to determine new targets. For instance, a proxy may choose to incorporate contacts obtained in
   a redirect response (3xx) into the target set. If a proxy uses a
   dynamic source of information while building the target set (for
   instance, if it consults a SIP Registrar), it SHOULD monitor that
   source for the duration of processing the request. New locations
   SHOULD be added to the target set as they become available. As
   above, any given URI MUST NOT be added to the set more than once.
