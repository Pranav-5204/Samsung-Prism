While in the "Trying" state, if the TU passes a provisional response
   to the server transaction, the server transaction MUST enter the
   "Proceeding" state. The response MUST be passed to the transport
   layer for transmission. Any further provisional responses that are
   received from the TU while in the "Proceeding" state MUST be passed
   to the transport layer for transmission. If a retransmission of the
   request is received while in the "Proceeding" state, the most
   recently sent provisional response MUST be passed to the transport
   layer for retransmission. If the TU passes a final response (status
   codes 200-699) to the server while in the "Proceeding" state, the
   transaction MUST enter the "Completed" state, and the response MUST
   be passed to the transport layer for transmission. When the server transaction enters the "Completed" state, it MUST set
   Timer J to fire in 64*T1 seconds for unreliable transports, and zero
   seconds for reliable transports.
