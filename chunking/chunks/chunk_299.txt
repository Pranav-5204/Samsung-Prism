The client transaction
   MUST pass the received response up to the TU, and the client
   transaction MUST generate an ACK request, even if the transport is
   reliable (guidelines for constructing the ACK from the response are
   given in Section 17.1.1.3) and then pass the ACK to the transport
   layer for transmission. The ACK MUST be sent to the same address,
   port, and transport to which the original request was sent. The
   client transaction SHOULD start timer D when it enters the
   "Completed" state, with a value of at least 32 seconds for unreliable
   transports, and a value of zero seconds for reliable transports. Timer D reflects the amount of time that the server transaction can
   remain in the "Completed" state when unreliable transports are used. This is equal to Timer H in the INVITE server transaction, whose    default is 64*T1.
