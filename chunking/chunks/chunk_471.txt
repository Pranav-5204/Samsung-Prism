When a UAS sends a response containing an S/MIME body that answers
   the first request in a dialog, or a response to a non-INVITE request
   outside the context of a dialog, the UAS SHOULD structure the body as
   an S/MIME ’multipart/signed’ CMS SignedData body. If the desired CMS
   service is EnvelopedData, the UAS SHOULD send the EnvelopedData
   message encapsulated within a SignedData message. When a UAC receives a response containing an S/MIME CMS body that
   includes a certificate, the UAC SHOULD first validate the
   certificate, if possible, with any appropriate root certificate. The
   UAC SHOULD also determine the subject of the certificate and compare
   this value to the To field of the response; although the two may very
   well be different, and this is not necessarily indicative of a
   security breach.
