The stateless proxy MAY use any technique it likes to guarantee
         uniqueness of its branch IDs across transactions. However, the
         following procedure is RECOMMENDED. The proxy examines the
         branch ID in the topmost Via header field of the received
         request. If it begins with the magic cookie, the first
         component of the branch ID of the outgoing request is computed
         as a hash of the received branch ID. Otherwise, the first
         component of the branch ID is computed as a hash of the topmost
         Via, the tag in the To header field, the tag in the From header
         field, the Call-ID header field, the CSeq number (but not
         method), and the Request-URI from the received request. One of
         these fields will always vary across two different
         transactions. o  All other message transformations specified in Section 16.6
         MUST result in the same transformation of a retransmitted
         request.
