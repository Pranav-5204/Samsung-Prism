This step, combined with the next, ensures that a stateful
         proxy will forward exactly one final response to a non-INVITE
         request, and either exactly one non-2xx response or one or more
         2xx responses to an INVITE request. 6. Choosing the best response
         A stateful proxy MUST send a final response to a response
         contextâ€™s server transaction if no final responses have been
         immediately forwarded by the above rules and all client
         transactions in this response context have been terminated. The stateful proxy MUST choose the "best" final response among
         those received and stored in the response context. If there are no final responses in the context, the proxy MUST
         send a 408 (Request Timeout) response to the server
         transaction. Otherwise, the proxy MUST forward a response from the responses
         stored in the response context. It MUST choose from the 6xx
         class responses if any exist in the context.
