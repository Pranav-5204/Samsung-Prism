The
         proxy MUST pass the response to the server transaction
         associated with the response context. This will result in the
         response being sent to the location now indicated in the
         topmost Via header field value. If the server transaction is
         no longer available to handle the transmission, the element
         MUST forward the response statelessly by sending it to the
         server transport. The server transaction might indicate
         failure to send the response or signal a timeout in its state
         machine. These errors would be logged for diagnostic purposes
         as appropriate, but the protocol requires no remedial action
         from the proxy. The proxy MUST maintain the response context until all of its
         associated transactions have been terminated, even after
         forwarding a final response. 10.
