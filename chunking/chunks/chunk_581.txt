That is disallowed here. The original INVITE needs a
      response. o  In RFC 2543, UAs needed to support only UDP. In this RFC, UAs
      need to support both UDP and TCP. o  In RFC 2543, a forking proxy only passed up one challenge from
      downstream elements in the event of multiple challenges. In this
      RFC, proxies are supposed to collect all challenges and place them
      into the forwarded response. o  In Digest credentials, the URI needs to be quoted; this is unclear
      from RFC 2617 and RFC 2069 which are both inconsistent on it. o  SDP processing has been split off into a separate specification
      [13], and more fully specified as a formal offer/answer exchange
      process that is effectively tunneled through SIP. SDP is allowed
      in INVITE/200 or 200/ACK for baseline SIP implementations; RFC
      2543 alluded to the ability to use it in INVITE, 200, and ACK in a
      single transaction, but this was not well specified.
