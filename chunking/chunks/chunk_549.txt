Once it has done so, and TLS
   negotiation has completed, resulting in a secure channel between the
   two proxies, the atlanta.com proxy can forward the INVITE request to
   biloxi.com. The proxy server at biloxi.com SHOULD inspect the certificate of the
   proxy server at atlanta.com in turn and compare the domain asserted
   by the certificate with the "domainname" portion of the From header
   field in the INVITE request. The biloxi proxy MAY have a strict
   security policy that requires it to reject requests that do not match
   the administrative domain from which they have been proxied. Such security policies could be instituted to prevent the SIP
      equivalent of SMTP ’open relays’ that are frequently exploited to
      generate spam. This policy, however, only guarantees that the request came from the
   domain it ascribes to itself; it does not allow biloxi.com to
   ascertain how atlanta.com authenticated Alice.
