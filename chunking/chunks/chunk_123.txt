This mechanism is known as
   registration. Registration entails sending a REGISTER request to a special type of
   UAS known as a registrar. A registrar acts as the front end to the
   location service for a domain, reading and writing mappings based on
   the contents of REGISTER requests. This location service is then
   typically consulted by a proxy server that is responsible for routing
   requests for that domain. An illustration of the overall registration process is given in
   Figure 2. Note that the registrar and proxy server are logical roles
   that can be played by a single device in a network; for purposes of    clarity the two are separated in this illustration. Also note that
   UAs may send requests through a proxy server in order to reach a
   registrar if the two are separate elements. SIP does not mandate a particular mechanism for implementing the
   location service.
