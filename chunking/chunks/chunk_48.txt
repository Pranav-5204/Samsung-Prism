For example, the user
   agent initiating a call acts as a UAC when sending the initial INVITE
   request and as a UAS when receiving a BYE request from the callee. Similarly, the same software can act as a proxy server for one
   request and as a redirect server for the next request. Proxy, location, and registrar servers defined above are logical
   entities; implementations MAY combine them into a single application. 7 SIP Messages
   SIP is a text-based protocol and uses the UTF-8 charset (RFC 2279
   [7]). A SIP message is either a request from a client to a server, or a
   response from a server to a client. Both Request (section 7.1) and Response (section 7.2) messages use
   the basic format of RFC 2822 [3], even though the syntax differs in
   character set and syntax specifics. (SIP allows header fields that
   would not be valid RFC 2822 header fields, for example.)
