The client transaction SHOULD inform the TU that a transport failure
   has occurred, and the client transaction SHOULD transition directly
   to the "Terminated" state. The TU will handle the failover
   mechanisms described in [4]. 17.2 Server Transaction
   The server transaction is responsible for the delivery of requests to
   the TU and the reliable transmission of responses. It accomplishes
   this through a state machine. Server transactions are created by the
   core when a request is received, and transaction handling is desired
   for that request (this is not always the case). As with the client transactions, the state machine depends on whether
   the received request is an INVITE request. 17.2.1 INVITE Server Transaction
   The state diagram for the INVITE server transaction is shown in
   Figure 7. When a server transaction is constructed for a request, it enters the
   "Proceeding" state.
