Add a Content-Length header field if necessary
         If the request will be sent to the next hop using a stream-
         based transport and the copy contains no Content-Length header
         field, the proxy MUST insert one with the correct value for the
         body of the request (see Section 20.14). 10. Forward Request
         A stateful proxy MUST create a new client transaction for this
         request as described in Section 17.1 and instructs the
         transaction to send the request using the address, port and
         transport determined in step 7. 11. Set timer C
         In order to handle the case where an INVITE request never
         generates a final response, the TU uses a timer which is called
         timer C.  Timer C MUST be set for each client transaction when
         an INVITE request is proxied. The timer MUST be larger than 3
         minutes.
