However, users SHOULD acquire certificates from known public
   certificate authorities. As an alternative, users MAY create self-
   signed certificates. The implications of self-signed certificates
   are explored further in Section 26.4.2. Implementations may also use
   pre-configured certificates in deployments in which a previous trust
   relationship exists between all SIP entities. Above and beyond the problem of acquiring an end-user certificate,
   there are few well-known centralized directories that distribute
   end-user certificates. However, the holder of a certificate SHOULD
   publish their certificate in any public directories as appropriate. Similarly, UACs SHOULD support a mechanism for importing (manually or
   automatically) certificates discovered in public directories
   corresponding to the target URIs of SIP requests. 23.2 S/MIME Key Exchange
