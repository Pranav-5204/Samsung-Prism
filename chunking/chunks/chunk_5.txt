For example, SIP can
   locate a user and deliver an opaque object to his current location. If this primitive is used to deliver a session description written in
   SDP, for instance, the endpoints can agree on the parameters of a
   session. If the same primitive is used to deliver a photo of the
   caller as well as the session description, a "caller ID" service can
   be easily implemented. As this example shows, a single primitive is
   typically used to provide several different services. SIP does not offer conference control services such as floor control
   or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed. SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference
   control protocol. Since SIP messages and the sessions they establish
   can pass through entirely different networks, SIP cannot, and does
   not, provide any kind of network resource reservation capabilities. The nature of the services provided make security particularly
   important.
