17.1.3 Matching Responses to Client Transactions
   When the transport layer in the client receives a response, it has to
   determine which client transaction will handle the response, so that
   the processing of Sections 17.1.1 and 17.1.2 can take place. The
   branch parameter in the top Via header field is used for this
   purpose. A response matches a client transaction under two
   conditions:
      1. If the response has the same value of the branch parameter in
          the top Via header field as the branch parameter in the top
          Via header field of the request that created the transaction. 2. If the method parameter in the CSeq header field matches the
          method of the request that created the transaction. The
          method is needed since a CANCEL request constitutes a
          different transaction, but shares the same value of the branch
          parameter.
