To guarantee that the registrar supports any necessary
         extensions, the registrar MUST process the Require header field
         values as described for UASs in Section 8.2.2. 3. A registrar SHOULD authenticate the UAC. Mechanisms for the
         authentication of SIP user agents are described in Section 22. Registration behavior in no way overrides the generic
         authentication framework for SIP. If no authentication
         mechanism is available, the registrar MAY take the From address
         as the asserted identity of the originator of the request. 4. The registrar SHOULD determine if the authenticated user is
         authorized to modify registrations for this address-of-record. For example, a registrar might consult an authorization
         database that maps user names to a list of addresses-of-record
         for which that user has authorization to modify bindings.
