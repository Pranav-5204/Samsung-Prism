If a 416 (Unsupported URI Scheme) response is received (Section
   21.4.14), the Request-URI used a URI scheme not supported by the
   server. The client SHOULD retry the request, this time, using a SIP
   URI. If a 420 (Bad Extension) response is received (Section 21.4.15), the
   request contained a Require or Proxy-Require header field listing an
   option-tag for a feature not supported by a proxy or UAS. The UAC
   SHOULD retry the request, this time omitting any extensions listed in
   the Unsupported header field in the response. In all of the above cases, the request is retried by creating a new
   request with the appropriate modifications. This new request
   constitutes a new transaction and SHOULD have the same value of the
   Call-ID, To, and From of the previous request, but the CSeq should
   contain a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous.
