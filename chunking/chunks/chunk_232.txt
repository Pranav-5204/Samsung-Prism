If the copy does not contain a Max-Forwards header field, the
         proxy MUST add one with a field value, which SHOULD be 70. Some existing UAs will not provide a Max-Forwards header field
         in a request. 4. Record-Route
         If this proxy wishes to remain on the path of future requests
         in a dialog created by this request (assuming the request
         creates a dialog), it MUST insert a Record-Route header field
         value into the copy before any existing Record-Route header
         field values, even if a Route header field is already present. Requests establishing a dialog may contain a preloaded Route
         header field. If this request is already part of a dialog, the proxy SHOULD
         insert a Record-Route header field value if it wishes to remain
         on the path of future requests in the dialog.
