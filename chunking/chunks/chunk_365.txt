Note that character escaping is not allowed in the host component of
   a SIP or SIPS URI (the % character is not valid in its expansion). This is likely to change in the future as requirements for
   Internationalized Domain Names are finalized. Current
   implementations MUST NOT attempt to improve robustness by treating
   received escaped characters in the host component as literally
   equivalent to their unescaped counterpart. The behavior required to
   meet the requirements of IDN may be significantly different. 19.1.3 Example SIP and SIPS URIs
   sip:alice@atlanta.com
   sip:alice:secretword@atlanta.com;transport=tcp
   sips:alice@atlanta.com?subject=project%20x&priority=urgent
   sip:+1-212-555-1212:1234@gateway.com;user=phone
   sips:1212@gateway.com
   sip:alice@192.0.2.4
   sip:atlanta.com;method=REGISTER?to=alice%40atlanta.com
   sip:alice;day=tuesday@atlanta.com
   The last sample URI above has a user field value of
   "alice;day=tuesday".
