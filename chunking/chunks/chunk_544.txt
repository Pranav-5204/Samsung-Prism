The UA then creates a REGISTER request that SHOULD be addressed to a
   Request-URI corresponding to the site certificate received from the
   registrar. When the UA sends the REGISTER request over the existing
   TLS connection, the registrar SHOULD challenge the request with a 401
   (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The "realm" parameter
   within the Proxy-Authenticate header field of the response SHOULD
   correspond to the domain previously given by the site certificate. When the UAC receives the challenge, it SHOULD either prompt the user
   for credentials or take an appropriate credential from a keyring
   corresponding to the "realm" parameter in the challenge. The
   username of this credential SHOULD correspond with the "userinfo"
   portion of the URI in the To header field of the REGISTER request. Once the Digest credentials have been inserted into an appropriate
   Proxy-Authorization header field, the REGISTER should be resubmitted
   to the registrar.
