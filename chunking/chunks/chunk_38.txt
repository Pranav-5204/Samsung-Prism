Loose Routing: A proxy is said to be loose routing if it follows
         the procedures defined in this specification for processing of
         the Route header field. These procedures separate the
         destination of the request (present in the Request-URI) from          the set of proxies that need to be visited along the way
         (present in the Route header field). A proxy compliant to
         these mechanisms is also known as a loose router. Message: Data sent between SIP elements as part of the protocol. SIP messages are either requests or responses. Method: The method is the primary function that a request is meant
         to invoke on a server. The method is carried in the request
         message itself. Example methods are INVITE and BYE. Outbound Proxy: A proxy that receives requests from a client, even
         though it may not be the server resolved by the Request-URI.
