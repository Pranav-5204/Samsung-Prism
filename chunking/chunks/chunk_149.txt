Typically,
   this is set to a format that is used to describe the media
   capabilities of a UA, such as SDP (application/sdp). The response to an OPTIONS request is assumed to be scoped to the
   Request-URI in the original request. However, only when an OPTIONS
   is sent as part of an established dialog is it guaranteed that future
   requests will be received by the server that generated the OPTIONS
   response. Example OPTIONS request:
      OPTIONS sip:carol@chicago.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bKhjhs8ass877

11.2 Processing of OPTIONS Request
   The response to an OPTIONS is constructed using the standard rules
   for a SIP response as discussed in Section 8.2.6.
