If
         the authenticated user is not authorized to modify bindings,
         the registrar MUST return a 403 (Forbidden) and skip the
         remaining steps. In architectures that support third-party registration, one
         entity may be responsible for updating the registrations
         associated with multiple addresses-of-record. 5. The registrar extracts the address-of-record from the To header
         field of the request. If the address-of-record is not valid
         for the domain in the Request-URI, the registrar MUST send a
         404 (Not Found) response and skip the remaining steps. The URI
         MUST then be converted to a canonical form. To do that, all
         URI parameters MUST be removed (including the user-param), and
         any escaped characters MUST be converted to their unescaped
         form. The result serves as an index into the list of bindings. 6. The registrar checks whether the request contains the Contact
         header field.
