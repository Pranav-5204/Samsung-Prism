If this fails, for example, elicits an ICMP "port
         unreachable" response, the procedures of Section 5 of [4]
         SHOULD be used to determine where to send the response. o  Otherwise, if it is not receiver-tagged, the response MUST be
         sent to the address indicated by the "sent-by" value, using the
         procedures in Section 5 of [4]. 18.3 Framing
   In the case of message-oriented transports (such as UDP), if the
   message has a Content-Length header field, the message body is
   assumed to contain that many bytes. If there are additional bytes in
   the transport packet beyond the end of the body, they MUST be
   discarded. If the transport packet ends before the end of the
   message body, this is considered an error. If the message is a
   response, it MUST be discarded. If the message is a request, the
   element SHOULD generate a 400 (Bad Request) response.
