This is because the UAC core
   handles retransmissions of the ACK, not the transaction layer. The
   ACK MUST be passed to the client transport every time a
   retransmission of the 2xx final response that triggered the ACK
   arrives. The UAC core considers the INVITE transaction completed 64*T1 seconds
   after the reception of the first 2xx response. At this point all the
   early dialogs that have not transitioned to established dialogs are
   terminated. Once the INVITE transaction is considered completed by
   the UAC core, no more new 2xx responses are expected to arrive. If, after acknowledging any 2xx response to an INVITE, the UAC does
   not want to continue with that dialog, then the UAC MUST terminate
   the dialog by sending a BYE request as described in Section 15. 13.3 UAS Processing
13.3.1 Processing of the INVITE
   The UAS core will receive INVITE requests from the transaction layer.
