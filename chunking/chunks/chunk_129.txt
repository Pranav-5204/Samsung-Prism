UACs SHOULD NOT use the "action" parameter. expires: The "expires" parameter indicates how long the UA would
           like the binding to be valid. The value is a number
           indicating seconds. If this parameter is not provided, the
           value of the Expires header field is used instead. Implementations MAY treat values larger than 2**32-1
           (4294967295 seconds or 136 years) as equivalent to 2**32-1. Malformed values SHOULD be treated as equivalent to 3600. 10.2.1 Adding Bindings
   The REGISTER request sent to a registrar includes the contact
   address(es) to which SIP requests for the address-of-record should be
   forwarded. The address-of-record is included in the To header field
   of the REGISTER request. The Contact header field values of the request typically consist of
   SIP or SIPS URIs that identify particular SIP endpoints (for example,
   "sip:carol@cube2214a.chicago.com"), but they MAY use any URI scheme.
