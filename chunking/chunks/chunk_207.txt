Therefore, if a UAC wishes to give up on its call attempt entirely,
   it can send a CANCEL. If the INVITE results in 2xx final response(s)
   to the INVITE, this means that a UAS accepted the invitation while
   the CANCEL was in progress. The UAC MAY continue with the sessions
   established by any 2xx responses, or MAY terminate them with BYE. The notion of "hanging up" is not well defined within SIP. It is
      specific to a particular, albeit common, user interface. Typically, when the user hangs up, it indicates a desire to
      terminate the attempt to establish a session, and to terminate any
      sessions already created. For the callerâ€™s UA, this would imply a
      CANCEL request if the initial INVITE has not generated a final
      response, and a BYE to all confirmed dialogs after a final
      response.
