Also, if the
   attacker is unable to learn the parameters of the session due to
   confidentiality, it would not be possible to forge the BYE. However,
   some intermediaries (like proxy servers) will need to inspect those
   parameters as the session is established. 26.1.5 Denial of Service and Amplification
   Denial-of-service attacks focus on rendering a particular network
   element unavailable, usually by directing an excessive amount of
   network traffic at its interfaces. A distributed denial-of-service
   attack allows one network user to cause multiple network hosts to
   flood a target host with a large amount of network traffic. In many architectures, SIP proxy servers face the public Internet in
   order to accept requests from worldwide IP endpoints. SIP creates a
   number of potential opportunities for distributed denial-of-service
   attacks that must be recognized and addressed by the implementers and
   operators of SIP systems.
