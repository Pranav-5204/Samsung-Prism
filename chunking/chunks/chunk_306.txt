The To
   header field in the ACK MUST equal the To header field in the
   response being acknowledged, and therefore will usually differ from
   the To header field in the original request by the addition of the
   tag parameter. The ACK MUST contain a single Via header field, and
   this MUST be equal to the top Via header field of the original
   request. The CSeq header field in the ACK MUST contain the same
   value for the sequence number as was present in the original request,
   but the method parameter MUST be equal to "ACK". If the INVITE request whose response is being acknowledged had Route
   header fields, those header fields MUST appear in the ACK. This is
   to ensure that the ACK can be routed properly through any downstream
   stateless proxies. Although any request MAY contain a body, a body in an ACK is special
   since the request cannot be rejected if the body is not understood.
