It also    MUST be prepared to receive incoming connections on any address and
   port that would be selected by a server based on the procedures
   described in Section 5 of [4]. For unreliable unicast transports, the client transport MUST be
   prepared to receive responses on the source IP address from which the
   request is sent (as responses are sent back to the source address)
   and the port number in the "sent-by" field. Furthermore, as with
   reliable transports, in certain cases the response will be sent
   elsewhere. The client MUST be prepared to receive responses on any
   address and port that would be selected by a server based on the
   procedures described in Section 5 of [4]. For multicast, the client transport MUST be prepared to receive
   responses on the same multicast group and port to which the request
   is sent (that is, it needs to be a member of the multicast group it
   sent the request to.)
