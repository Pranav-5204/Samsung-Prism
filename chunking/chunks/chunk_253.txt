If the proxy chooses to recurse on any contacts in a 3xx
         response by adding them to the target set, it MUST remove them
         from the response before adding the response to the response
         context. However, a proxy SHOULD NOT recurse to a non-SIPS URI
         if the Request-URI of the original request was a SIPS URI. If          the proxy recurses on all of the contacts in a 3xx response,
         the proxy SHOULD NOT add the resulting contactless response to
         the response context. Removing the contact before adding the response to the response
         context prevents the next element upstream from retrying a
         location this proxy has already attempted. 3xx responses may contain a mixture of SIP, SIPS, and non-SIP
         URIs. A proxy may choose to recurse on the SIP and SIPS URIs
         and place the remainder into the response context to be
         returned, potentially in the final response.
