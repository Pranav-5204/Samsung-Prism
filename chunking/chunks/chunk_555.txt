26.3.2.4 DoS Protection
   In order to minimize the risk of a denial-of-service attack against
   architectures using these security solutions, implementers should
   take note of the following guidelines. When the host on which a SIP proxy server is operating is routable
   from the public Internet, it SHOULD be deployed in an administrative
   domain with defensive operational policies (blocking source-routed
   traffic, preferably filtering ping traffic). Both TLS and IPSec can
   also make use of bastion hosts at the edges of administrative domains
   that participate in the security associations to aggregate secure
   tunnels and sockets. These bastion hosts can also take the brunt of
   denial-of-service attacks, ensuring that SIP hosts within the
   administrative domain are not encumbered with superfluous messaging.
