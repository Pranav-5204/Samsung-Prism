A dialog established by a non-final
   response to a request is in the "early" state and it is called an
   early dialog. Extensions MAY define other means for creating
   dialogs. Section 13 gives more details that are specific to the
   INVITE method. Here, we describe the process for creation of dialog
   state that is not dependent on the method. UAs MUST assign values to the dialog ID components as described
   below. 12.1.1 UAS behavior
   When a UAS responds to a request with a response that establishes a
   dialog (such as a 2xx to INVITE), the UAS MUST copy all Record-Route
   header field values from the request into the response (including the
   URIs, URI parameters, and any Record-Route header field parameters,
   whether they are known or unknown to the UAS) and MUST maintain the
   order of those values. The UAS MUST add a Contact header field to
   the response.
