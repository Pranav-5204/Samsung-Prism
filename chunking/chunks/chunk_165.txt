Therefore, if
   the local sequence number is not empty, the value of the local
   sequence number MUST be incremented by one, and this value MUST be
   placed into the CSeq header field. If the local sequence number is
   empty, an initial value MUST be chosen using the guidelines of
   Section 8.1.1.5. The method field in the CSeq header field value
   MUST match the method of the request. With a length of 32 bits, a client could generate, within a single
      call, one request a second for about 136 years before needing to
      wrap around. The initial value of the sequence number is chosen
      so that subsequent requests within the same call will not wrap
      around. A non-zero initial value allows clients to use a time-
      based initial sequence number. A client could, for example,
      choose the 31 most significant bits of a 32-bit second clock as an
      initial sequence number.
