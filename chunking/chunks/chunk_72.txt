The following is an example of a valid To header field:
      To: Carol <sip:carol@chicago.com>
8.1.1.3 From
   The From header field indicates the logical identity of the initiator
   of the request, possibly the userâ€™s address-of-record. Like the To
   header field, it contains a URI and optionally a display name. It is
   used by SIP elements to determine which processing rules to apply to
   a request (for example, automatic call rejection). As such, it is
   very important that the From URI not contain IP addresses or the FQDN
   of the host on which the UA is running, since these are not logical
   names. The From header field allows for a display name. A UAC SHOULD use
   the display name "Anonymous", along with a syntactically correct, but
   otherwise meaningless URI (like sip:thisis@anonymous.invalid), if the
   identity of the client is to remain hidden.
