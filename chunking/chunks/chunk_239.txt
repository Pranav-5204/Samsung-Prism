INVITE is the only such
         request in this specification, but extensions to the protocol
         MAY define others. 5. Add Additional Header Fields
         The proxy MAY add any other appropriate header fields to the
         copy at this point. 6. Postprocess routing information
         A proxy MAY have a local policy that mandates that a request
         visit a specific set of proxies before being delivered to the
         destination. A proxy MUST ensure that all such proxies are
         loose routers. Generally, this can only be known with
         certainty if the proxies are within the same administrative
         domain. This set of proxies is represented by a set of URIs
         (each of which contains the lr parameter). This set MUST be
         pushed into the Route header field of the copy ahead of any
         existing values, if present. If the Route header field is
         absent, it MUST be added, containing that list of URIs.
