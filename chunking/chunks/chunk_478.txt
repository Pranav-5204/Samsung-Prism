o  "multipart/signed" MUST be used only with CMS detached
         signatures. This allows backwards compatibility with non-S/MIME-
            compliant recipients. o  S/MIME bodies SHOULD have a Content-Disposition header field,
         and the value of the "handling" parameter SHOULD be "required." o  If a UAC has no certificate on its keyring associated with the
         address-of-record to which it wants to send a request, it
         cannot send an encrypted "application/pkcs7-mime" MIME message. UACs MAY send an initial request such as an OPTIONS message
         with a CMS detached signature in order to solicit the
         certificate of the remote side (the signature SHOULD be over a
         "message/sip" body of the type described in Section 23.4). Note that future standardization work on S/MIME may define
            non-certificate based keys.
