This is a change
   from past practice, and is instituted to ensure continuing multi-
   vendor interoperability (see discussion in Section 20.32 and Section
   20.37). An IANA registry of option tags is used to ensure easy
   reference. 19.3 Tags
   The "tag" parameter is used in the To and From header fields of SIP
   messages. It serves as a general mechanism to identify a dialog,
   which is the combination of the Call-ID along with two tags, one from
   each participant in the dialog. When a UA sends a request outside of
   a dialog, it contains a From tag only, providing "half" of the dialog
   ID. The dialog is completed from the response(s), each of which
   contributes the second half in the To header field. The forking of
   SIP requests means that multiple dialogs can be established from a
   single request.
