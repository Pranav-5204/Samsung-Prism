A SIP UA can choose to register telephone numbers (with the tel URL,
   RFC 2806 [9]) or email addresses (with a mailto URL, RFC 2368 [32])
   as Contacts for an address-of-record, for example. For example, Carol, with address-of-record "sip:carol@chicago.com",
   would register with the SIP registrar of the domain chicago.com. Her
   registrations would then be used by a proxy server in the chicago.com
   domain to route requests for Carolâ€™s address-of-record to her SIP
   endpoint. Once a client has established bindings at a registrar, it MAY send
   subsequent registrations containing new bindings or modifications to
   existing bindings as necessary. The 2xx response to the REGISTER
   request will contain, in a Contact header field, a complete list of
   bindings that have been registered for this address-of-record at this
   registrar.
