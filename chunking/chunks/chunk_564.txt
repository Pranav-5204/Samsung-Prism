Note that since many UAs will not accept
   incoming TLS connections, even those UAs that do support TLS may be
   required to maintain persistent TLS connections as described in the
   TLS limitations section above in order to receive requests over TLS
   as a UAS. Location services are not required to provide a SIPS binding for a
   SIPS Request-URI. Although location services are commonly populated
   by user registrations (as described in Section 10.2.1), various other
   protocols and interfaces could conceivably supply contact addresses
   for an AOR, and these tools are free to map SIPS URIs to SIP URIs as
   appropriate. When queried for bindings, a location service returns
   its contact addresses without regard for whether it received a
   request with a SIPS Request-URI. If a redirect server is accessing
   the location service, it is up to the entity that processes the
   Contact header field of a redirection to determine the propriety of
   the contact addresses.
