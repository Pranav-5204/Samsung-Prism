For
   example, if the call was already hung up with a BYE, the re-INVITE
   would not take place. The rules for transmitting a re-INVITE and for generating an ACK for
   a 2xx response to re-INVITE are the same as for the initial INVITE
   (Section 13.2.1). 14.2 UAS Behavior
   Section 13.3.1 describes the procedure for distinguishing incoming
   re-INVITEs from incoming initial INVITEs and handling a re-INVITE for
   an existing dialog. A UAS that receives a second INVITE before it sends the final
   response to a first INVITE with a lower CSeq sequence number on the
   same dialog MUST return a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the
   second INVITE and MUST include a Retry-After header field with a
   randomly chosen value of between 0 and 10 seconds. A UAS that receives an INVITE on a dialog while an INVITE it had sent
   on that dialog is in progress MUST return a 491 (Request Pending)
   response to the received INVITE.
