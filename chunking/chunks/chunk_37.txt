Location Service: A location service is used by a SIP redirect or
         proxy server to obtain information about a calleeâ€™s possible
         location(s). It contains a list of bindings of address-of-
         record keys to zero or more contact addresses. The bindings
         can be created and removed in many ways; this specification
         defines a REGISTER method that updates the bindings. Loop: A request that arrives at a proxy, is forwarded, and later
         arrives back at the same proxy. When it arrives the second
         time, its Request-URI is identical to the first time, and other
         header fields that affect proxy operation are unchanged, so
         that the proxy would make the same processing decision on the
         request it made the first time. Looped requests are errors,
         and the procedures for detecting them and handling them are
         described by the protocol.
