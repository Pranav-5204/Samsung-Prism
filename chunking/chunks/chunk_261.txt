A proxy MUST NOT modify the To tag in any forwarded response to
         a request that contains a To tag. While it makes no difference to the upstream elements if the
         proxy replaced the To tag in a forwarded 3-6xx response,
         preserving the original tag may assist with debugging. When the proxy is aggregating information from several
         responses, choosing a To tag from among them is arbitrary, and
         generating a new To tag may make debugging easier. This
         happens, for instance, when combining 401 (Unauthorized) and
         407 (Proxy Authentication Required) challenges, or combining
         Contact values from unencrypted and unauthenticated 3xx
         responses. 7.
