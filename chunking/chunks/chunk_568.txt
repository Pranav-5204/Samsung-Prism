Of course, there are some safeguards against this (if the
   destination UA is truly paranoid it could refuse all non-SIPS
   requests), but it is a limitation worth noting. On the bright side,
   users might also divine that ’SIPS’ would be valid even when they are
   presented only with a SIP URI. 26.5 Privacy
   SIP messages frequently contain sensitive information about their
   senders - not just what they have to say, but with whom they
   communicate, when they communicate and for how long, and from where
   they participate in sessions. Many applications and their users
   require that this sort of private information be hidden from any
   parties that do not need to know it. Note that there are also less direct ways in which private
   information can be divulged.
