13.2 UAC Processing
13.2.1 Creating the Initial INVITE
   Since the initial INVITE represents a request outside of a dialog,
   its construction follows the procedures of Section 8.1.1. Additional
   processing is required for the specific case of INVITE. An Allow header field (Section 20.5) SHOULD be present in the INVITE. It indicates what methods can be invoked within a dialog, on the UA
   sending the INVITE, for the duration of the dialog. For example, a
   UA capable of receiving INFO requests within a dialog [34] SHOULD
   include an Allow header field listing the INFO method. A Supported header field (Section 20.37) SHOULD be present in the
   INVITE. It enumerates all the extensions understood by the UAC. An Accept (Section 20.1) header field MAY be present in the INVITE. It indicates which Content-Types are acceptable to the UA, in both
   the response received by it, and in any subsequent requests sent to
   it within dialogs established by the INVITE.
