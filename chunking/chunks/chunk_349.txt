If the message
   has no Content-Length header field, the message body is assumed to
   end at the end of the transport packet. In the case of stream-oriented transports such as TCP, the Content-
   Length header field indicates the size of the body. The Content-
   Length header field MUST be used with stream oriented transports. 18.4 Error Handling
   Error handling is independent of whether the message was a request or
   response. If the transport user asks for a message to be sent over an
   unreliable transport, and the result is an ICMP error, the behavior
   depends on the type of ICMP error. Host, network, port or protocol
   unreachable errors, or parameter problem errors SHOULD cause the
   transport layer to inform the transport user of a failure in sending. Source quench and TTL exceeded ICMP errors SHOULD be ignored.
