If no body is present in a message, then the
   Content-Length header field value MUST be set to zero. The ability to omit Content-Length simplifies the creation of
      cgi-like scripts that dynamically generate responses. The compact form of the header field is l.
   Examples:
      Content-Length: 349
      l: 173
20.15 Content-Type
   The Content-Type header field indicates the media type of the
   message-body sent to the recipient. The "media-type" element is
   defined in [H3.7]. The Content-Type header field MUST be present if
   the body is not empty. If the body is empty, and a Content-Type
   header field is present, it indicates that the body of the specific
   type has zero length (for example, an empty audio file). The compact form of the header field is c.
   Examples:
      Content-Type: application/sdp
      c: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4
20.16 CSeq
   A CSeq header field in a request contains a single decimal sequence
   number and the request method.
