Inclusion of the tag in the To header field in the ACK matching
   process helps disambiguate ACK for 2xx from ACK for other responses    at a proxy, which may have forwarded both responses (This can occur
   in unusual conditions. Specifically, when a proxy forked a request,
   and then crashes, the responses may be delivered to another proxy,
   which might end up forwarding multiple responses upstream). An ACK
   request that matches an INVITE transaction matched by a previous ACK
   is considered a retransmission of that previous ACK.
