The only requirement is that a registrar for some
   domain MUST be able to read and write data to the location service,
   and a proxy or a redirect server for that domain MUST be capable of
   reading that same data. A registrar MAY be co-located with a
   particular SIP proxy server for the same domain. 10.2 Constructing the REGISTER Request
   REGISTER requests add, remove, and query bindings. A REGISTER
   request can add a new binding between an address-of-record and one or
   more contact addresses. Registration on behalf of a particular
   address-of-record can be performed by a suitably authorized third
   party. A client can also remove previous bindings or query to
   determine which bindings are currently in place for an address-of-
   record. Except as noted, the construction of the REGISTER request and the
   behavior of clients sending a REGISTER request is identical to the
   general UAC behavior described in Section 8.1 and Section 17.1.
