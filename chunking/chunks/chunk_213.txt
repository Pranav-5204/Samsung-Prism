For
   instance, a proxy MAY forward a request from one TCP connection to
   another transaction statelessly as long as it places enough
   information in the message to be able to forward the response down
   the same connection the request arrived on. Requests forwarded
   between different types of transports where the proxyâ€™s TU must take
   an active role in ensuring reliable delivery on one of the transports
   MUST be forwarded transaction statefully. A stateful proxy MAY transition to stateless operation at any time
   during the processing of a request, so long as it did not do anything
   that would otherwise prevent it from being stateless initially
   (forking, for example, or generation of a 100 response). When
   performing such a transition, all state is simply discarded. The
   proxy SHOULD NOT initiate a CANCEL request. Much of the processing involved when acting statelessly or statefully
   for a request is identical.
