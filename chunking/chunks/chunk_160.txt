If the request has a Request-
   URI or a topmost Route header field value with a SIPS URI, the
   Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS URI. When a UAC receives a response that establishes a dialog, it
   constructs the state of the dialog. This state MUST be maintained
   for the duration of the dialog. If the request was sent over TLS, and the Request-URI contained a
   SIPS URI, the "secure" flag is set to TRUE. The route set MUST be set to the list of URIs in the Record-Route
   header field from the response, taken in reverse order and preserving
   all URI parameters. If no Record-Route header field is present in
   the response, the route set MUST be set to the empty set. This route
   set, even if empty, overrides any pre-existing route set for future
   requests in this dialog. The remote target MUST be set to the URI
   from the Contact header field of the response.
