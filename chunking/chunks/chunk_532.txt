IPSec is most commonly used in architectures in which a
   set of hosts or administrative domains have an existing trust
   relationship with one another. IPSec is usually implemented at the
   operating system level in a host, or on a security gateway that
   provides confidentiality and integrity for all traffic it receives
   from a particular interface (as in a VPN architecture). IPSec can
   also be used on a hop-by-hop basis. In many architectures IPSec does not require integration with SIP
   applications; IPSec is perhaps best suited to deployments in which
   adding security directly to SIP hosts would be arduous. UAs that
   have a pre-shared keying relationship with their first-hop proxy
   server are also good candidates to use IPSec. Any deployment of
   IPSec for SIP would require an IPSec profile describing the protocol
   tools that would be required to secure SIP. No such profile is given
   in this document.
