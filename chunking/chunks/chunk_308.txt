For example, consider the following request:
   INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bKkjshdyff
   To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>
   From: Alice <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;tag=88sja8x
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Call-ID: 987asjd97y7atg
   CSeq: 986759 INVITE
   The ACK request for a non-2xx final response to this request would
   look like this:
   ACK sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bKkjshdyff
   To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=99sa0xk
   From: Alice <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;tag=88sja8x
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Call-ID: 987asjd97y7atg
   CSeq: 986759 ACK
17.1.2 Non-INVITE Client Transaction
17.1.2.1 Overview of the non-INVITE Transaction
   Non-INVITE transactions do not make use of ACK. They are simple
   request-response interactions. For unreliable transports, requests
   are retransmitted at an interval which starts at T1 and doubles until
   it hits T2.
