The external column describes
   URIs appearing anywhere outside of a SIP message, for instance on a
   web page or business card. Entries marked "m" are mandatory, those
   marked "o" are optional, and those marked "-" are not allowed. Elements processing URIs SHOULD ignore any disallowed components if
   they are present. The second column indicates the default value of
   an optional element if it is not present.  " --" indicates that the
   element is either not optional, or has no default value. URIs in Contact header fields have different restrictions depending
   on the context in which the header field appears. One set applies to
   messages that establish and maintain dialogs (INVITE and its 200 (OK)
   response). The other applies to registration and redirection
   messages (REGISTER, its 200 (OK) response, and 3xx class responses to
   any method).
