Typically, a UA is manually configured with an outbound proxy,
         or can learn about one through auto-configuration protocols. Parallel Search: In a parallel search, a proxy issues several
         requests to possible user locations upon receiving an incoming
         request. Rather than issuing one request and then waiting for
         the final response before issuing the next request as in a
         sequential search, a parallel search issues requests without
         waiting for the result of previous requests. Provisional Response: A response used by the server to indicate
         progress, but that does not terminate a SIP transaction. 1xx
         responses are provisional, other responses are considered
         final. Proxy, Proxy Server: An intermediary entity that acts as both a
         server and a client for the purpose of making requests on
         behalf of other clients.
