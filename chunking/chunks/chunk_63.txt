7.4.1 Message Body Type
   The Internet media type of the message body MUST be given by the
   Content-Type header field. If the body has undergone any encoding
   such as compression, then this MUST be indicated by the Content-
   Encoding header field; otherwise, Content-Encoding MUST be omitted. If applicable, the character set of the message body is indicated as
   part of the Content-Type header-field value. The "multipart" MIME type defined in RFC 2046 [11] MAY be used within
   the body of the message. Implementations that send requests
   containing multipart message bodies MUST send a session description
   as a non-multipart message body if the remote implementation requests
   this through an Accept header field that does not contain multipart. SIP messages MAY contain binary bodies or body parts. When no
   explicit charset parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes
   of the "text" type are defined to have a default charset value of
   "UTF-8".
