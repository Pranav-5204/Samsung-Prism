If the request being cancelled contains a Route header field, the
   CANCEL request MUST include that Route header fieldâ€™s values. This is needed so that stateless proxies are able to route CANCEL
      requests properly. The CANCEL request MUST NOT contain any Require or Proxy-Require
   header fields. Once the CANCEL is constructed, the client SHOULD check whether it
   has received any response (provisional or final) for the request
   being cancelled (herein referred to as the "original request"). If no provisional response has been received, the CANCEL request MUST
   NOT be sent; rather, the client MUST wait for the arrival of a
   provisional response before sending the request. If the original
   request has generated a final response, the CANCEL SHOULD NOT be
   sent, as it is an effective no-op, since CANCEL has no effect on
   requests that have already generated a final response.
