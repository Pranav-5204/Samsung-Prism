The "outer"
   message will have the proper MIME header fields for S/MIME bodies. These header fields (and any MIME bodies they preface) should be
   treated as normal MIME header fields and bodies received in a SIP
   message. It is not particularly useful to encrypt the following header fields:
   Min-Expires, Timestamp, Authorization, Priority, and WWW-
   Authenticate. This category also includes those header fields that
   can be changed by proxy servers (described in the preceding section). UAs SHOULD never include these in an "inner" message if they are not
   included in the "outer" message. UAs that receive any of these
   header fields in an encrypted body SHOULD ignore the encrypted
   values. Note that extensions to SIP may define additional header fields; the
   authors of these extensions should describe the integrity and
   confidentiality properties of such header fields.
