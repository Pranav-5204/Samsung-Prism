This behavior can be used
      as a "traceroute" functionality to check the capabilities of
      individual hop servers by sending a series of OPTIONS requests
      with incremented Max-Forwards values. As is the case for general UA behavior, the transaction layer can
   return a timeout error if the OPTIONS yields no response. This may
   indicate that the target is unreachable and hence unavailable. An OPTIONS request MAY be sent as part of an established dialog to
   query the peer on capabilities that may be utilized later in the
   dialog. 11.1 Construction of OPTIONS Request
   An OPTIONS request is constructed using the standard rules for a SIP
   request as discussed in Section 8.1.1. A Contact header field MAY be present in an OPTIONS. An Accept header field SHOULD be included to indicate the type of
   message body the UAC wishes to receive in the response.
