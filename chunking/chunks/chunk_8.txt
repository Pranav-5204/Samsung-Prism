Alice might have typed in Bob’s URI or perhaps clicked on a hyperlink
   or an entry in an address book. SIP also provides a secure URI,
   called a SIPS URI. An example would be sips:bob@biloxi.com. A call
   made to a SIPS URI guarantees that secure, encrypted transport
   (namely TLS) is used to carry all SIP messages from the caller to the
   domain of the callee. From there, the request is sent securely to
   the callee, but with security mechanisms that depend on the policy of
   the domain of the callee. SIP is based on an HTTP-like request/response transaction model. Each transaction consists of a request that invokes a particular
   method, or function, on the server and at least one response. In
   this example, the transaction begins with Alice’s softphone sending
   an INVITE request addressed to Bob’s SIP URI. INVITE is an example
   of a SIP method that specifies the action that the requestor (Alice)
   wants the server (Bob) to take.
