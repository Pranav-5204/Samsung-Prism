21.4.11 413 Request Entity Too Large
   The server is refusing to process a request because the request
   entity-body is larger than the server is willing or able to process. The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from
   continuing the request. If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD include a Retry-
   After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what
   time the client MAY try again. 21.4.12 414 Request-URI Too Long
   The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI
   is longer than the server is willing to interpret. 21.4.13 415 Unsupported Media Type
   The server is refusing to service the request because the message
   body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for
   the requested method. The server MUST return a list of acceptable
   formats using the Accept, Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header
   field, depending on the specific problem with the content.
