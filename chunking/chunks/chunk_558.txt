The existing replay protection mechanisms described in RFC 2617 also
   have some limitations for SIP. The next-nonce mechanism, for
   example, does not support pipelined requests. The nonce-count
   mechanism should be used for replay protection. Another limitation of HTTP Digest is the scope of realms. Digest is
   valuable when a user wants to authenticate themselves to a resource
   with which they have a pre-existing association, like a service    provider of which the user is a customer (which is quite a common
   scenario and thus Digest provides an extremely useful function). By
   way of contrast, the scope of TLS is interdomain or multirealm, since
   certificates are often globally verifiable, so that the UA can
   authenticate the server with no pre-existing association. 26.4.2 S/MIME
   The largest outstanding defect with the S/MIME mechanism is the lack
   of a prevalent public key infrastructure for end users.
