A Request-Line contains a method name, a Request-URI, and the
   protocol version separated by a single space (SP) character. The Request-Line ends with CRLF. No CR or LF are allowed except in
   the end-of-line CRLF sequence. No linear whitespace (LWS) is allowed
   in any of the elements. Request-Line  =  Method SP Request-URI SP SIP-Version CRLF
      Method: This specification defines six methods: REGISTER for
           registering contact information, INVITE, ACK, and CANCEL for
           setting up sessions, BYE for terminating sessions, and
           OPTIONS for querying servers about their capabilities. SIP
           extensions, documented in standards track RFCs, may define
           additional methods. Request-URI: The Request-URI is a SIP or SIPS URI as described in
           Section 19.1 or a general URI (RFC 2396 [5]). It indicates
           the user or service to which this request is being addressed.
