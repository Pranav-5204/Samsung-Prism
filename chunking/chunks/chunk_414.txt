The compact form of the To header field is t.
   The following are examples of valid To header fields:
      To: The Operator <sip:operator@cs.columbia.edu>;tag=287447
      t: sip:+12125551212@server.phone2net.com
20.40 Unsupported
   The Unsupported header field lists the features not supported by the
   UAS. See Section 20.32 for motivation. Example:
      Unsupported: foo
20.41 User-Agent
   The User-Agent header field contains information about the UAC
   originating the request. The semantics of this header field are
   defined in [H14.43]. Revealing the specific software version of the user agent might allow
   the user agent to become more vulnerable to attacks against software
   that is known to contain security holes. Implementers SHOULD make
   the User-Agent header field a configurable option.
