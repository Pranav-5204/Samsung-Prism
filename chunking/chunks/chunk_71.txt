This is useful for features like
   "speed dial" that require interpretation of the user part in the home
   domain. The tel URL may be used when the UA does not wish to specify
   the domain that should interpret a telephone number that has been
   input by the user. Rather, each domain through which the request
   passes would be given that opportunity. As an example, a user in an
   airport might log in and send requests through an outbound proxy in
   the airport. If they enter "411" (this is the phone number for local
   directory assistance in the United States), that needs to be
   interpreted and processed by the outbound proxy in the airport, not
   the userâ€™s home domain. In this case, tel:411 would be the right
   choice. A request outside of a dialog MUST NOT contain a To tag; the tag in
   the To field of a request identifies the peer of the dialog. Since
   no dialog is established, no tag is present. For further information on the To header field, see Section 20.39.
