Furthermore, when handling a request statelessly,
   an element MUST NOT generate its own 100 (Trying) or any other
   provisional response. A stateless proxy MUST validate a request as described in Section
   16.3
   A stateless proxy MUST follow the request processing steps described
   in Sections 16.4 through 16.5 with the following exception:
      o  A stateless proxy MUST choose one and only one target from the
         target set. This choice MUST only rely on fields in the
         message and time-invariant properties of the server. In
         particular, a retransmitted request MUST be forwarded to the
         same destination each time it is processed. Furthermore,
         CANCEL and non-Routed ACK requests MUST generate the same
         choice as their associated INVITE.
