Its use of intermediaries,
   its multi-faceted trust relationships, its expected usage between
   elements with no trust at all, and its user-to-user operation make
   security far from trivial. Security solutions are needed that are
   deployable today, without extensive coordination, in a wide variety
   of environments and usages. In order to meet these diverse needs,
   several distinct mechanisms applicable to different aspects and
   usages of SIP will be required. Note that the security of SIP signaling itself has no bearing on the
   security of protocols used in concert with SIP such as RTP, or with
   the security implications of any specific bodies SIP might carry
   (although MIME security plays a substantial role in securing SIP). Any media associated with a session can be encrypted end-to-end
   independently of any associated SIP signaling. Media encryption is
   outside the scope of this document.
