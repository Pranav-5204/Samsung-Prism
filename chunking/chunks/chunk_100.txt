If a UAS does not understand an option-tag listed in a
   Require header field, it MUST respond by generating a response with
   status code 420 (Bad Extension). The UAS MUST add an Unsupported
   header field, and list in it those options it does not understand
   amongst those in the Require header field of the request. Note that Require and Proxy-Require MUST NOT be used in a SIP CANCEL
   request, or in an ACK request sent for a non-2xx response. These
   header fields MUST be ignored if they are present in these requests. An ACK request for a 2xx response MUST contain only those Require and
   Proxy-Require values that were present in the initial request.
