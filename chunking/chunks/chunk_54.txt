SIP/2.0 allows
   six values for the first digit:
      1xx: Provisional -- request received, continuing to process the
           request;
      2xx: Success -- the action was successfully received, understood,
           and accepted;
      3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order to
           complete the request;
      4xx: Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or cannot be
           fulfilled at this server;
      5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an apparently
           valid request;
      6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any
           server. Section 21 defines these classes and describes the individual codes. 7.3 Header Fields
   SIP header fields are similar to HTTP header fields in both syntax
   and semantics. In particular, SIP header fields follow the [H4.2]
   definitions of syntax for the message-header and the rules for
   extending header fields over multiple lines.
