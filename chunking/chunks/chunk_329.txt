If the branch parameter in the top Via header field is not present,
   or does not contain the magic cookie, the following procedures are
   used. These exist to handle backwards compatibility with RFC 2543
   compliant implementations. The INVITE request matches a transaction if the Request-URI, To tag,
   From tag, Call-ID, CSeq, and top Via header field match those of the
   INVITE request which created the transaction. In this case, the
   INVITE is a retransmission of the original one that created the
   transaction. The ACK request matches a transaction if the Request-
   URI, From tag, Call-ID, CSeq number (not the method), and top Via
   header field match those of the INVITE request which created the
   transaction, and the To tag of the ACK matches the To tag of the
   response sent by the server transaction. Matching is done based on
   the matching rules defined for each of those header fields.
