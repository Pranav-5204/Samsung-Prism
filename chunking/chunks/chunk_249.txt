Section 16.7 bullet 2 discusses how this timer is
         updated with provisional responses, and Section 16.8 discusses
         processing when it fires. 16.7 Response Processing
   When a response is received by an element, it first tries to locate a
   client transaction (Section 17.1.3) matching the response. If none
   is found, the element MUST process the response (even if it is an
   informational response) as a stateless proxy (described below). If a
   match is found, the response is handed to the client transaction. Forwarding responses for which a client transaction (or more
      generally any knowledge of having sent an associated request) is
      not found improves robustness. In particular, it ensures that
      "late" 2xx responses to INVITE requests are forwarded properly. As client transactions pass responses to the proxy layer, the
   following processing MUST take place:
      1. Find the appropriate response context
      2.
