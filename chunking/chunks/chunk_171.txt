If the
   request has a tag in the To header field, the UAS core computes the
   dialog identifier corresponding to the request and compares it with
   existing dialogs. If there is a match, this is a mid-dialog request. In that case, the UAS first applies the same processing rules for
   requests outside of a dialog, discussed in Section 8.2. If the request has a tag in the To header field, but the dialog
   identifier does not match any existing dialogs, the UAS may have
   crashed and restarted, or it may have received a request for a
   different (possibly failed) UAS (the UASs can construct the To tags
   so that a UAS can identify that the tag was for a UAS for which it is
   providing recovery). Another possibility is that the incoming
   request has been simply misrouted. Based on the To tag, the UAS MAY
   either accept or reject the request. Accepting the request for
   acceptable To tags provides robustness, so that dialogs can persist
   even through crashes.
