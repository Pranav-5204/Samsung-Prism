Procedures for
   the generation of tags are defined in Section 19.3. 8.2.7 Stateless UAS Behavior
   A stateless UAS is a UAS that does not maintain transaction state. It replies to requests normally, but discards any state that would
   ordinarily be retained by a UAS after a response has been sent. If a
   stateless UAS receives a retransmission of a request, it regenerates
   the response and resends it, just as if it were replying to the first
   instance of the request. A UAS cannot be stateless unless the request
   processing for that method would always result in the same response
   if the requests are identical. This rules out stateless registrars,
   for example. Stateless UASs do not use a transaction layer; they
   receive requests directly from the transport layer and send responses
   directly to the transport layer. The stateless UAS role is needed primarily to handle unauthenticated
   requests for which a challenge response is issued.
