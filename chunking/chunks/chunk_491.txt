Some
   informational header fields, such as the Subject or Organization
   could perhaps warrant end-to-end security. Headers defined by future
   SIP applications might also require obfuscation. Another possible application of encrypting header fields is selective
   anonymity. A request could be constructed with a From header field
   that contains no personal information (for example,
   sip:anonymous@anonymizer.invalid). However, a second From header
   field containing the genuine address-of-record of the originator
   could be encrypted within a "message/sip" MIME body where it will
   only be visible to the endpoints of a dialog. Note that if this mechanism is used for anonymity, the From header
      field will no longer be usable by the recipient of a message as an
      index to their certificate keychain for retrieving the proper
      S/MIME key to associated with the sender.
