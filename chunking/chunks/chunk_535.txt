When used as the Request-URI of a
   request, the SIPS scheme signifies that each hop over which the
   request is forwarded, until the request reaches the SIP entity
   responsible for the domain portion of the Request-URI, must be
   secured with TLS; once it reaches the domain in question it is
   handled in accordance with local security and routing policy, quite
   possibly using TLS for any last hop to a UAS. When used by the
   originator of a request (as would be the case if they employed a SIPS
   URI as the address-of-record of the target), SIPS dictates that the
   entire request path to the target domain be so secured. The SIPS scheme is applicable to many of the other ways in which SIP
   URIs are used in SIP today in addition to the Request-URI, including
   in addresses-of-record, contact addresses (the contents of Contact
   headers, including those of REGISTER methods), and Route headers.
