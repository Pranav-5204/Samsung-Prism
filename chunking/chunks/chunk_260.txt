Since a proxy may not insert a tag into the To header field of
         a 1xx response to a request that did not contain one, it cannot
         issue non-100 provisional responses on its own. However, it
         can branch the request to a UAS sharing the same element as the
         proxy. This UAS can return its own provisional responses,
         entering into an early dialog with the initiator of the
         request. The UAS does not have to be a discreet process from
         the proxy. It could be a virtual UAS implemented in the same
         code space as the proxy. 3-6xx responses are delivered hop-by-hop. When issuing a 3-6xx
         response, the element is effectively acting as a UAS, issuing
         its own response, usually based on the responses received from
         downstream elements. An element SHOULD preserve the To tag
         when simply forwarding a 3-6xx response to a request that did
         not contain a To tag.
