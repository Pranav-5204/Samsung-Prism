                  / LWS
   ctext includes all chars except left and right parens and backslash. A string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted using
   double-quote marks. In quoted strings, quotation marks (") and
   backslashes (\) need to be escaped. quoted-string  =  SWS DQUOTE *(qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE
      qdtext         =  LWS / %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E
                        / UTF8-NONASCII
   The backslash character ("\") MAY be used as a single-character
   quoting mechanism only within quoted-string and comment constructs. Unlike HTTP/1.1, the characters CR and LF cannot be escaped by this
   mechanism to avoid conflict with line folding and header separation.
