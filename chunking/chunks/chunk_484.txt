23.4.1.2 Confidentiality
   When messages are encrypted, header fields may be included in the
   encrypted body that are not present in the "outer" message. Some header fields must always have a plaintext version because they
   are required header fields in requests and responses - these include:
   To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, Contact. While it is probably not useful to
   provide an encrypted alternative for the Call-ID, CSeq, or Contact,
   providing an alternative to the information in the "outer" To or From
   is permitted. Note that the values in an encrypted body are not used
   for the purposes of identifying transactions or dialogs - they are
   merely informational. If the From header field in an encrypted body
   differs from the value in the "outer" message, the value within the
   encrypted body SHOULD be displayed to the user, but MUST NOT be used
   in the "outer" header fields of any future messages.
