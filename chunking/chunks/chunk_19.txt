(There are three Via header field values - one
   added by Alice’s SIP phone, one added by the atlanta.com proxy, and
   one added by the biloxi.com proxy.) Bob’s SIP phone has added a tag
   parameter to the To header field. This tag will be incorporated by
   both endpoints into the dialog and will be included in all future    requests and responses in this call. The Contact header field
   contains a URI at which Bob can be directly reached at his SIP phone. The Content-Type and Content-Length refer to the message body (not
   shown) that contains Bob’s SDP media information. In addition to DNS and location service lookups shown in this
   example, proxy servers can make flexible "routing decisions" to
   decide where to send a request. For example, if Bob’s SIP phone
   returned a 486 (Busy Here) response, the biloxi.com proxy server
   could proxy the INVITE to Bob’s voicemail server. A proxy server can
   also send an INVITE to a number of locations at the same time.
