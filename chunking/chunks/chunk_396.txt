If this header field is missing, the MIME type determines the default
   content disposition. If there is none, "render" is assumed. Example:
      Content-Disposition: session
20.12 Content-Encoding
   The Content-Encoding header field is used as a modifier to the
   "media-type". When present, its value indicates what additional
   content codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what
   decoding mechanisms MUST be applied in order to obtain the media-type
   referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
   primarily used to allow a body to be compressed without losing the
   identity of its underlying media type. If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity-body, the
   content codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were
   applied. All content-coding values are case-insensitive. IANA acts as a
   registry for content-coding value tokens. See [H3.5] for a
   definition of the syntax for content-coding.
