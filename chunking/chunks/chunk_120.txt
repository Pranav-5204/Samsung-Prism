If the UAS has not issued a final response
   for the original request, its behavior depends on the method of the
   original request. If the original request was an INVITE, the UAS
   SHOULD immediately respond to the INVITE with a 487 (Request
   Terminated). A CANCEL request has no impact on the processing of
   transactions with any other method defined in this specification. Regardless of the method of the original request, as long as the
   CANCEL matched an existing transaction, the UAS answers the CANCEL
   request itself with a 200 (OK) response. This response is
   constructed following the procedures described in Section 8.2.6
   noting that the To tag of the response to the CANCEL and the To tag
   in the response to the original request SHOULD be the same. The
   response to CANCEL is passed to the server transaction for
   transmission. 10 Registrations
