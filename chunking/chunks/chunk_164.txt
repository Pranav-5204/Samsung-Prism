If the value of the remote or local tags is null,
   the tag parameter MUST be omitted from the To or From header fields,
   respectively. Usage of the URI from the To and From fields in the original
      request within subsequent requests is done for backwards
      compatibility with RFC 2543, which used the URI for dialog
      identification. In this specification, only the tags are used for
      dialog identification. It is expected that mandatory reflection
      of the original To and From URI in mid-dialog requests will be
      deprecated in a subsequent revision of this specification. The Call-ID of the request MUST be set to the Call-ID of the dialog. Requests within a dialog MUST contain strictly monotonically
   increasing and contiguous CSeq sequence numbers (increasing-by-one)
   in each direction (excepting ACK and CANCEL of course, whose numbers
   equal the requests being acknowledged or cancelled).
