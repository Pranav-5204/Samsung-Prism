Under an authentication scheme that uses responses to carry values
   used to compute nonces (such as Digest), some problems come up for
   any requests that take no response, including ACK. For this reason,
   any credentials in the INVITE that were accepted by a server MUST be
   accepted by that server for the ACK. UACs creating an ACK message
   will duplicate all of the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization
   header field values that appeared in the INVITE to which the ACK
   corresponds. Servers MUST NOT attempt to challenge an ACK. Although the CANCEL method does take a response (a 2xx), servers MUST
   NOT attempt to challenge CANCEL requests since these requests cannot
   be resubmitted. Generally, a CANCEL request SHOULD be accepted by a
   server if it comes from the same hop that sent the request being
   canceled (provided that some sort of transport or network layer
   security association, as described in Section 26.2.1, is in place).
