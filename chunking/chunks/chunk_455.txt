If a proxy were to resubmit a request adding a Proxy-Authorization
      header field value, it would need to increment the CSeq in the new
      request. However, this would cause the UAC that submitted the
      original request to discard a response from the UAS, as the CSeq
      value would be different. When the originating UAC receives the 407 (Proxy Authentication
   Required) it SHOULD, if it is able, re-originate the request with the
   proper credentials. It should follow the same procedures for the
   display of the "realm" parameter that are given above for responding
   to 401. If no credentials for a realm can be located, UACs MAY attempt to
   retry the request with a username of "anonymous" and no password (a
   password of ""). The UAC SHOULD also cache the credentials used in the re-originated
   request.
