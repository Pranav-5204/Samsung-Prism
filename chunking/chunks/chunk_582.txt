      SDP usages are allowed in extensions. o  Added full support for IPv6 in URIs and in the Via header field. Support for IPv6 in Via has required that its header field
      parameters allow the square bracket and colon characters. These
      characters were previously not permitted. In theory, this could
      cause interop problems with older implementations. However, we
      have observed that most implementations accept any non-control
      ASCII character in these parameters. o  DNS SRV procedure is now documented in a separate specification
      [4]. This procedure uses both SRV and NAPTR resource records and
      no longer combines data from across SRV records as described in
      RFC 2543.
   o  Loop detection has been made optional, supplanted by a mandatory
      usage of Max-Forwards. The loop detection procedure in RFC 2543
      had a serious bug which would report "spirals" as an error
      condition when it was not.
