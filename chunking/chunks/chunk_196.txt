Response retransmissions cease when an ACK request for
   the response is received. This is independent of whatever transport
   protocols are used to send the response. Since 2xx is retransmitted end-to-end, there may be hops between
      UAS and UAC that are UDP. To ensure reliable delivery across
      these hops, the response is retransmitted periodically even if the
      transport at the UAS is reliable. If the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1 seconds without
   receiving an ACK, the dialog is confirmed, but the session SHOULD be
   terminated. This is accomplished with a BYE, as described in Section
   15. 14 Modifying an Existing Session
   A successful INVITE request (see Section 13) establishes both a
   dialog between two user agents and a session using the offer-answer
   model. Section 12 explains how to modify an existing dialog using a
   target refresh request (for example, changing the remote target URI
   of the dialog).
