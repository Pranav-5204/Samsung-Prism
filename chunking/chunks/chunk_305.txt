No transaction layer processing takes place. Whenever a response is received by the transport, if the transport
   layer finds no matching client transaction (using the rules of
   Section 17.1.3), the response is passed directly to the core. Since
   the matching client transaction is destroyed by the first 2xx,
   subsequent 2xx will find no match and therefore be passed to the
   core. 17.1.1.3 Construction of the ACK Request
   This section specifies the construction of ACK requests sent within
   the client transaction. A UAC core that generates an ACK for 2xx
   MUST instead follow the rules described in Section 13. The ACK request constructed by the client transaction MUST contain
   values for the Call-ID, From, and Request-URI that are equal to the
   values of those header fields in the request passed to the transport
   by the client transaction (call this the "original request").
