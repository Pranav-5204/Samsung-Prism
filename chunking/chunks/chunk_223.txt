A request may arrive with a maddr matching the proxy, but on a
      port or transport different from that indicated in the URI. Such
      a request needs to be forwarded to the proxy using the indicated
      port and transport. If the first value in the Route header field indicates this proxy,
   the proxy MUST remove that value from the request. 16.5 Determining Request Targets
   Next, the proxy calculates the target(s) of the request. The set of
   targets will either be predetermined by the contents of the request
   or will be obtained from an abstract location service. Each target
   in the set is represented as a URI. If the Request-URI of the request contains an maddr parameter, the
   Request-URI MUST be placed into the target set as the only target
   URI, and the proxy MUST proceed to Section 16.6.
