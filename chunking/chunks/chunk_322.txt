This is identical to the retransmit behavior for requests in the
   "Trying" state of the non-INVITE client transaction. Furthermore,
   while in the "Completed" state, if a request retransmission is
   received, the server SHOULD pass the response to the transport for
   retransmission. If an ACK is received while the server transaction is in the
   "Completed" state, the server transaction MUST transition to the
   "Confirmed" state. As Timer G is ignored in this state, any
   retransmissions of the response will cease. If timer H fires while in the "Completed" state, it implies that the
   ACK was never received. In this case, the server transaction MUST
   transition to the "Terminated" state, and MUST indicate to the TU
   that a transaction failure has occurred.
