On future occasions, when the UA receives requests or responses that
   contain a From header field corresponding to a value in its keyring,
   the UA SHOULD compare the certificate offered in these messages with
   the existing certificate in its keyring. If there is a discrepancy,
   the UA MUST notify its user of a change of the certificate
   (preferably in terms that indicate that this is a potential security
   breach) and acquire the userâ€™s permission before continuing to    process the signaling. If the user authorizes this certificate, it
   SHOULD be added to the keyring alongside any previous value(s) for
   this address-of-record. Note well however, that this key exchange mechanism does not
   guarantee the secure exchange of keys when self-signed certificates,
   or certificates signed by an obscure authority, are used - it is
   vulnerable to well-known attacks.
