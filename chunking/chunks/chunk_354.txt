For instance,
         transporting a PIN number in this field exposes the PIN. Note that the password field is just an extension of the user
         portion. Implementations not wishing to give special
         significance to the password portion of the field MAY simply
         treat "user:password" as a single string. host: The host providing the SIP resource. The host part contains
         either a fully-qualified domain name or numeric IPv4 or IPv6
         address. Using the fully-qualified domain name form is
         RECOMMENDED whenever possible. port: The port number where the request is to be sent. URI parameters: Parameters affecting a request constructed from
         the URI. URI parameters are added after the hostport component and are
         separated by semi-colons.
