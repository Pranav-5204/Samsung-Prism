If no credentials (in the Proxy-Authorization header
   field) are provided in the request, the proxy can challenge the
   originator to provide credentials by rejecting the request with a 407
   (Proxy Authentication Required) status code. The proxy MUST populate
   the 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) message with a Proxy-
   Authenticate header field value applicable to the proxy for the
   requested resource. The use of Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization parallel that
   described in [17], with one difference. Proxies MUST NOT add values
   to the Proxy-Authorization header field. All 407 (Proxy
   Authentication Required) responses MUST be forwarded upstream toward
   the UAC following the procedures for any other response. It is the
   UACâ€™s responsibility to add the Proxy-Authorization header field
   value containing credentials for the realm of the proxy that has
   asked for authentication.
