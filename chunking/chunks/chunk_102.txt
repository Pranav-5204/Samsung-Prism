If there are any bodies whose type (indicated by the
   Content-Type), language (indicated by the Content-Language) or
   encoding (indicated by the Content-Encoding) are not understood, and
   that body part is not optional (as indicated by the Content-
   Disposition header field), the UAS MUST reject the request with a 415
   (Unsupported Media Type) response. The response MUST contain an
   Accept header field listing the types of all bodies it understands,
   in the event the request contained bodies of types not supported by
   the UAS. If the request contained content encodings not understood
   by the UAS, the response MUST contain an Accept-Encoding header field
   listing the encodings understood by the UAS. If the request
   contained content with languages not understood by the UAS, the
   response MUST contain an Accept-Language header field indicating the
   languages understood by the UAS. Beyond these checks, body handling
   depends on the method and type.
