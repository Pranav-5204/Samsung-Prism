If the UAS has reason to believe that the scheme of the Request-URI
   has been improperly modified in transit, the UA SHOULD notify its
   user of a potential security breach. As a further measure to prevent downgrade attacks, entities that
   accept only SIPS requests MAY also refuse connections on insecure
   ports. End users will undoubtedly discern the difference between SIPS and
   SIP URIs, and they may manually edit them in response to stimuli. This can either benefit or degrade security. For example, if an
   attacker corrupts a DNS cache, inserting a fake record set that
   effectively removes all SIPS records for a proxy server, then any
   SIPS requests that traverse this proxy server may fail. When a user,
   however, sees that repeated calls to a SIPS AOR are failing, they
   could on some devices manually convert the scheme from SIPS to SIP
   and retry.
