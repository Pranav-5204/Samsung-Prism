It does see that it is the first value in the
   Route header field, so it removes that value, and forwards the
   request to P2:
      BYE sip:callee@u2.domain.com SIP/2.0
      Route: <sip:p2.domain.com;lr>
   P2 also notices it is not responsible for the resource indicated by
   the Request-URI (it is responsible for domain.com, not
   u2.domain.com), so it doesnâ€™t change it. It does see itself in the
   first Route header field value, so it removes it and forwards the
   following to u2.domain.com based on a DNS lookup against the
   Request-URI:
      BYE sip:callee@u2.domain.com SIP/2.0
16.12.1.2 Traversing a Strict-Routing Proxy
   In this scenario, a dialog is established across four proxies, each
   of which adds Record-Route header field values. The third proxy
   implements the strict-routing procedures specified in RFC 2543 and
   many works in progress.
