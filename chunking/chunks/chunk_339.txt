Before a request is sent, the client transport MUST insert a value of
   the "sent-by" field into the Via header field. This field contains
   an IP address or host name, and port. The usage of an FQDN is
   RECOMMENDED. This field is used for sending responses under certain
   conditions, described below. If the port is absent, the default
   value depends on the transport. It is 5060 for UDP, TCP and SCTP,
   5061 for TLS. For reliable transports, the response is normally sent on the
   connection on which the request was received. Therefore, the client
   transport MUST be prepared to receive the response on the same
   connection used to send the request. Under error conditions, the
   server may attempt to open a new connection to send the response. To
   handle this case, the transport layer MUST also be prepared to
   receive an incoming connection on the source IP address from which
   the request was sent and port number in the "sent-by" field.
