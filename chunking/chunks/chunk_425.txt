21.3.1 300 Multiple Choices
   The address in the request resolved to several choices, each with its
   own specific location, and the user (or UA) can select a preferred
   communication end point and redirect its request to that location. The response MAY include a message body containing a list of resource
   characteristics and location(s) from which the user or UA can choose
   the one most appropriate, if allowed by the Accept request header
   field. However, no MIME types have been defined for this message
   body. The choices SHOULD also be listed as Contact fields (Section 20.10). Unlike HTTP, the SIP response MAY contain several Contact fields or a
   list of addresses in a Contact field. UAs MAY use the Contact header
   field value for automatic redirection or MAY ask the user to confirm
   a choice. However, this specification does not define any standard
   for such automatic selection.
