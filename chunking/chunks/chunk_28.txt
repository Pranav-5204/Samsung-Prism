Transactions are a
   fundamental component of SIP. A transaction is a request sent by a
   client transaction (using the transport layer) to a server
   transaction, along with all responses to that request sent from the
   server transaction back to the client. The transaction layer handles
   application-layer retransmissions, matching of responses to requests,
   and application-layer timeouts. Any task that a user agent client
   (UAC) accomplishes takes place using a series of transactions. Discussion of transactions can be found in Section 17. User agents
   contain a transaction layer, as do stateful proxies. Stateless
   proxies do not contain a transaction layer. The transaction layer
   has a client component (referred to as a client transaction) and a
   server component (referred to as a server transaction), each of which
   are represented by a finite state machine that is constructed to
   process a particular request.
