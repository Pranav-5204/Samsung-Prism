The address
   of the atlanta.com SIP server could have been configured in Alice’s
   softphone, or it could have been discovered by DHCP, for example. The atlanta.com SIP server is a type of SIP server known as a proxy
   server. A proxy server receives SIP requests and forwards them on
   behalf of the requestor. In this example, the proxy server receives
   the INVITE request and sends a 100 (Trying) response back to Alice’s
   softphone. The 100 (Trying) response indicates that the INVITE has
   been received and that the proxy is working on her behalf to route
   the INVITE to the destination. Responses in SIP use a three-digit
   code followed by a descriptive phrase. This response contains the
   same To, From, Call-ID, CSeq and branch parameter in the Via as the
   INVITE, which allows Alice’s softphone to correlate this response to
   the sent INVITE.
