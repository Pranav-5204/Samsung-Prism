If the client transaction is still in the "Calling" state when timer
   B fires, the client transaction SHOULD inform the TU that a timeout
   has occurred. The client transaction MUST NOT generate an ACK. The
   value of 64*T1 is equal to the amount of time required to send seven
   requests in the case of an unreliable transport. If the client transaction receives a provisional response while in
   the "Calling" state, it transitions to the "Proceeding" state. In the
   "Proceeding" state, the client transaction SHOULD NOT retransmit the
   request any longer. Furthermore, the provisional response MUST be
   passed to the TU. Any further provisional responses MUST be passed
   up to the TU while in the "Proceeding" state. When in either the "Calling" or "Proceeding" states, reception of a
   response with status code from 300-699 MUST cause the client
   transaction to transition to "Completed".
