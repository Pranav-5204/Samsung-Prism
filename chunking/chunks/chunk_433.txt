A UAS SHOULD NOT use this response unless it truly cannot provide any
   useful service to the client. Instead, if a desirable extension is
   not listed in the Supported header field, servers SHOULD process the
   request using baseline SIP capabilities and any extensions supported
   by the client. 21.4.17 423 Interval Too Brief
   The server is rejecting the request because the expiration time of
   the resource refreshed by the request is too short. This response
   can be used by a registrar to reject a registration whose Contact
   header field expiration time was too small. The use of this response
   and the related Min-Expires header field are described in Sections
   10.2.8, 10.3, and 20.23. 21.4.18 480 Temporarily Unavailable
   The calleeâ€™s end system was contacted successfully but the callee is
   currently unavailable (for example, is not logged in, logged in but
   in a state that precludes communication with the callee, or has
   activated the "do not disturb" feature).
