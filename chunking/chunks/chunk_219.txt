If the request contains a Max-Forwards header field with a field
      value of zero (0), the element MUST NOT forward the request. If
      the request was for OPTIONS, the element MAY act as the final
      recipient and respond per Section 11. Otherwise, the element MUST
      return a 483 (Too many hops) response. 4. Optional Loop Detection check
      An element MAY check for forwarding loops before forwarding a
      request. If the request contains a Via header field with a sent-
      by value that equals a value placed into previous requests by the
      proxy, the request has been forwarded by this element before. The
      request has either looped or is legitimately spiraling through the
      element. To determine if the request has looped, the element MAY
      perform the branch parameter calculation described in Step 8 of
      Section 16.6 on this message and compare it to the parameter
      received in that Via header field.
