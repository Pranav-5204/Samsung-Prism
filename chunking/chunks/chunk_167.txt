The UAC MUST then place the remote target URI into the
   Route header field as the last value. For example, if the remote target is sip:user@remoteua and the route
   set contains:
      <sip:proxy1>,<sip:proxy2>,<sip:proxy3;lr>,<sip:proxy4>
   The request will be formed with the following Request-URI and Route
   header field:
   METHOD sip:proxy1
   Route: <sip:proxy2>,<sip:proxy3;lr>,<sip:proxy4>,<sip:user@remoteua>
      If the first URI of the route set does not contain the lr
      parameter, the proxy indicated does not understand the routing
      mechanisms described in this document and will act as specified in
      RFC 2543, replacing the Request-URI with the first Route header
      field value it receives while forwarding the message. Placing the
      Request-URI at the end of the Route header field preserves the       information in that Request-URI across the strict router (it will
      be returned to the Request-URI when the request reaches a loose-
      router).
