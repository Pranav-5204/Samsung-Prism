Clients MAY apply content encodings to the body in requests. A
   server MAY apply content encodings to the bodies in responses. The
   server MUST only use encodings listed in the Accept-Encoding header
   field in the request. The compact form of the Content-Encoding header field is e.
   Examples:
      Content-Encoding: gzip
      e: tar
20.13 Content-Language
   See [H14.12]. Example:
      Content-Language: fr
20.14 Content-Length
   The Content-Length header field indicates the size of the message-
   body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient. Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the size of the
   message-body to be transferred, regardless of the media type of the
   entity. If a stream-based protocol (such as TCP) is used as
   transport, the header field MUST be used. The size of the message-body does not include the CRLF separating
   header fields and body. Any Content-Length greater than or equal to
   zero is a valid value.
