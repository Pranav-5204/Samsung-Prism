A stateless proxy MUST follow the request processing steps described
   in Section 16.6 with the following exceptions:
      o  The requirement for unique branch IDs across space and time
         applies to stateless proxies as well. However, a stateless
         proxy cannot simply use a random number generator to compute
         the first component of the branch ID, as described in Section
         16.6 bullet 8. This is because retransmissions of a request
         need to have the same value, and a stateless proxy cannot tell
         a retransmission from the original request. Therefore, the
         component of the branch parameter that makes it unique MUST be
         the same each time a retransmitted request is forwarded. Thus
         for a stateless proxy, the branch parameter MUST be computed as
         a combinatoric function of message parameters which are
         invariant on retransmission.
