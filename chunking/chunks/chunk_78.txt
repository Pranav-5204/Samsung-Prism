The protocol name and protocol version in the header field
   MUST be SIP and 2.0, respectively. The Via header field value MUST
   contain a branch parameter. This parameter is used to identify the
   transaction created by that request. This parameter is used by both
   the client and the server. The branch parameter value MUST be unique across space and time for
   all requests sent by the UA. The exceptions to this rule are CANCEL
   and ACK for non-2xx responses. As discussed below, a CANCEL request
   will have the same value of the branch parameter as the request it
   cancels. As discussed in Section 17.1.1.3, an ACK for a non-2xx
   response will also have the same branch ID as the INVITE whose
   response it acknowledges. The uniqueness property of the branch ID parameter, to facilitate
      its use as a transaction ID, was not part of RFC 2543. The branch ID inserted by an element compliant with this
   specification MUST always begin with the characters "z9hG4bK".
