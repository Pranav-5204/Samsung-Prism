This is to prevent servers from insisting that
   clients implement non-standard, vendor-defined features in order to
   receive service. Extensions defined by experimental and
   informational RFCs are explicitly excluded from usage with the
   Supported header field in a request, since they too are often used to
   document vendor-defined extensions. If the UAC wishes to insist that a UAS understand an extension that
   the UAC will apply to the request in order to process the request, it
   MUST insert a Require header field into the request listing the
   option tag for that extension. If the UAC wishes to apply an
   extension to the request and insist that any proxies that are    traversed understand that extension, it MUST insert a Proxy-Require
   header field into the request listing the option tag for that
   extension.
