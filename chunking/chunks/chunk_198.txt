If the user hangs up upon media failure, the
      UA would send a BYE request as usual. 14.1 UAC Behavior
   The same offer-answer model that applies to session descriptions in
   INVITEs (Section 13.2.1) applies to re-INVITEs. As a result, a UAC
   that wants to add a media stream, for example, will create a new
   offer that contains this media stream, and send that in an INVITE
   request to its peer. It is important to note that the full
   description of the session, not just the change, is sent. This
   supports stateless session processing in various elements, and
   supports failover and recovery capabilities. Of course, a UAC MAY    send a re-INVITE with no session description, in which case the first
   reliable non-failure response to the re-INVITE will contain the offer
   (in this specification, that is a 2xx response).
