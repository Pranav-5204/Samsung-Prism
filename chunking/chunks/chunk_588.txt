o  A UA or proxy cannot send CANCEL for a transaction until it gets a
      provisional response for the request. This was allowed in RFC
      2543 but leads to potential race conditions. o  The action parameter in registrations has been deprecated. It was
      insufficient for any useful services, and caused conflicts when
      application processing was applied in proxies. o  RFC 2543 had a number of special cases for multicast. For
      example, certain responses were suppressed, timers were adjusted,
      and so on. Multicast now plays a more limited role, and the
      protocol operation is unaffected by usage of multicast as opposed
      to unicast. The limitations as a result of that are documented. o  Basic authentication has been removed entirely and its usage
      forbidden. o  Proxies no longer forward a 6xx immediately on receiving it. Instead, they CANCEL pending branches immediately.
