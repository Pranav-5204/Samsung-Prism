22.4 The Digest Authentication Scheme
   This section describes the modifications and clarifications required
   to apply the HTTP Digest authentication scheme to SIP. The SIP
   scheme usage is almost completely identical to that for HTTP [17]. Since RFC 2543 is based on HTTP Digest as defined in RFC 2069 [39],
   SIP servers supporting RFC 2617 MUST ensure they are backwards
   compatible with RFC 2069. Procedures for this backwards
   compatibility are specified in RFC 2617. Note, however, that SIP
   servers MUST NOT accept or request Basic authentication. The rules for Digest authentication follow those defined in [17],
   with "HTTP/1.1" replaced by "SIP/2.0" in addition to the following
   differences:
      1. The URI included in the challenge has the following BNF:
          URI  =  SIP-URI / SIPS-URI
      2.
