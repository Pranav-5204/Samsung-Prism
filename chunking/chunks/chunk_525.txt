Consider a case in which a third-party attacker captures some initial
   messages in a dialog shared by two parties in order to learn the
   parameters of the session (To tag, From tag, and so forth) and then
   inserts a BYE request into the session. The attacker could opt to
   forge the request such that it seemed to come from either
   participant. Once the BYE is received by its target, the session
   will be torn down prematurely. Similar mid-session threats include the transmission of forged re-
   INVITEs that alter the session (possibly to reduce session security
   or redirect media streams as part of a wiretapping attack). The most effective countermeasure to this threat is the
   authentication of the sender of the BYE. In this instance, the
   recipient needs only know that the BYE came from the same party with
   whom the corresponding dialog was established (as opposed to
   ascertaining the absolute identity of the sender).
