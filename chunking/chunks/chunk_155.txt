This state consists of the dialog
   ID, a local sequence number (used to order requests from the UA to
   its peer), a remote sequence number (used to order requests from its
   peer to the UA), a local URI, a remote URI, remote target, a boolean
   flag called "secure", and a route set, which is an ordered list of
   URIs. The route set is the list of servers that need to be traversed
   to send a request to the peer. A dialog can also be in the "early"
   state, which occurs when it is created with a provisional response,
   and then transition to the "confirmed" state when a 2xx final
   response arrives. For other responses, or if no response arrives at
   all on that dialog, the early dialog terminates. 12.1 Creation of a Dialog
   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses
   to requests with specific methods. Within this specification, only
   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag, where the request was
   INVITE, will establish a dialog.
