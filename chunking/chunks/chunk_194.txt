A 486 (Busy Here)
   SHOULD be returned in such a scenario. If the UAS knows that no
   other end system will be able to accept this call, a 600 (Busy
   Everywhere) response SHOULD be sent instead. However, it is unlikely
   that a UAS will be able to know this in general, and thus this
   response will not usually be used. The response is passed to the
   INVITE server transaction, which will deal with its retransmissions. A UAS rejecting an offer contained in an INVITE SHOULD return a 488
   (Not Acceptable Here) response. Such a response SHOULD include a
   Warning header field value explaining why the offer was rejected. 13.3.1.4 The INVITE is Accepted
   The UAS core generates a 2xx response. This response establishes a
   dialog, and therefore follows the procedures of Section 12.1.1 in
   addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A 2xx response to an INVITE SHOULD contain the Allow header field and
   the Supported header field, and MAY contain the Accept header field.
