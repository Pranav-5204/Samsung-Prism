This
   type of parallel search is known as forking. In this case, the 200 (OK) is routed back through the two proxies and
   is received by Alice’s softphone, which then stops the ringback tone
   and indicates that the call has been answered. Finally, Alice’s
   softphone sends an acknowledgement message, ACK, to Bob’s SIP phone
   to confirm the reception of the final response (200 (OK)). In this
   example, the ACK is sent directly from Alice’s softphone to Bob’s SIP
   phone, bypassing the two proxies. This occurs because the endpoints
   have learned each other’s address from the Contact header fields
   through the INVITE/200 (OK) exchange, which was not known when the
   initial INVITE was sent. The lookups performed by the two proxies
   are no longer needed, so the proxies drop out of the call flow. This
   completes the INVITE/200/ACK three-way handshake used to establish
   SIP sessions. Full details on session setup are in Section 13.
