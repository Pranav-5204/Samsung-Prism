A dialog
   represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents
   that persists for some time. The dialog facilitates sequencing of
   messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests
   between both of them. The dialog represents a context in which to
   interpret SIP messages. Section 8 discussed method independent UA
   processing for requests and responses outside of a dialog. This
   section discusses how those requests and responses are used to
   construct a dialog, and then how subsequent requests and responses
   are sent within a dialog. A dialog is identified at each UA with a dialog ID, which consists of
   a Call-ID value, a local tag and a remote tag. The dialog ID at each
   UA involved in the dialog is not the same. Specifically, the local
   tag at one UA is identical to the remote tag at the peer UA. The
   tags are opaque tokens that facilitate the generation of unique
   dialog IDs.
