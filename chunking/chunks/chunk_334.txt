Note that, because the source
   port is often ephemeral, but it cannot be known whether it is
   ephemeral or selected through procedures in [4], connections accepted
   by the transport layer will frequently not be reused. The result is
   that two proxies in a "peering" relationship using a connection-
   oriented transport frequently will have two connections in use, one
   for transactions initiated in each direction. It is RECOMMENDED that connections be kept open for some
   implementation-defined duration after the last message was sent or
   received over that connection. This duration SHOULD at least equal
   the longest amount of time the element would need in order to bring a
   transaction from instantiation to the terminated state. This is to
   make it likely that transactions are completed over the same
   connection on which they are initiated (for example, request,
   response, and in the case of INVITE, ACK for non-2xx responses).
