For example, consider a case in which a redirect server at one
   domain, chicago.com, impersonates a redirect server at another
   domain, biloxi.com. A user agent sends a request to biloxi.com, but
   the redirect server at chicago.com answers with a forged response
   that has appropriate SIP header fields for a response from
   biloxi.com. The forged contact addresses in the redirection response
   could direct the originating UA to inappropriate or insecure
   resources, or simply prevent requests for biloxi.com from succeeding. This family of threats has a vast membership, many of which are
   critical. As a converse to the registration hijacking threat,
   consider the case in which a registration sent to biloxi.com is
   intercepted by chicago.com, which replies to the intercepted
   registration with a forged 301 (Moved Permanently) response. This
   response might seem to come from biloxi.com yet designate chicago.com
   as the appropriate registrar.
