If a request
   retransmission is received while in the "Proceeding" state, the most
   recent provisional response that was received from the TU MUST be
   passed to the transport layer for retransmission. A request is a
   retransmission if it matches the same server transaction based on the
   rules of Section 17.2.3. If, while in the "Proceeding" state, the TU passes a 2xx response to
   the server transaction, the server transaction MUST pass this
   response to the transport layer for transmission. It is not    retransmitted by the server transaction; retransmissions of 2xx
   responses are handled by the TU. The server transaction MUST then
   transition to the "Terminated" state. While in the "Proceeding" state, if the TU passes a response with
   status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response
   MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state
   machine MUST enter the "Completed" state.
