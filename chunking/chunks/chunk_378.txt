This also explains the need for the two-sided dialog
   identifier; without a contribution from the recipients, the
   originator could not disambiguate the multiple dialogs established
   from a single request. When a tag is generated by a UA for insertion into a request or
   response, it MUST be globally unique and cryptographically random
   with at least 32 bits of randomness. A property of this selection
   requirement is that a UA will place a different tag into the From
   header of an INVITE than it would place into the To header of the
   response to the same INVITE. This is needed in order for a UA to
   invite itself to a session, a common case for "hairpinning" of calls
   in PSTN gateways. Similarly, two INVITEs for different calls will
   have different From tags, and two responses for different calls will
   have different To tags. Besides the requirement for global uniqueness, the algorithm for
   generating a tag is implementation-specific.
