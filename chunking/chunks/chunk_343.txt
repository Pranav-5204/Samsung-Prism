It is also RECOMMENDED that a server
   listen for requests on the default SIP ports (5060 for TCP and UDP,
   5061 for TLS over TCP) on all public interfaces. The typical
   exception would be private networks, or when multiple server
   instances are running on the same host. For any port and interface
   that a server listens on for UDP, it MUST listen on that same port
   and interface for TCP. This is because a message may need to be sent
   using TCP, rather than UDP, if it is too large. As a result, the
   converse is not true. A server need not listen for UDP on a
   particular address and port just because it is listening on that same
   address and port for TCP. There may, of course, be other reasons why
   a server needs to listen for UDP on a particular address and port. When the server transport receives a request over any transport, it
   MUST examine the value of the "sent-by" parameter in the top Via
   header field value.
