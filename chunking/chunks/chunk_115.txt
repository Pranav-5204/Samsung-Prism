Since requests other than INVITE are responded to immediately,
      sending a CANCEL for a non-INVITE request would always create a
      race condition. The following procedures are used to construct a CANCEL request. The
   Request-URI, Call-ID, To, the numeric part of CSeq, and From header
   fields in the CANCEL request MUST be identical to those in the
   request being cancelled, including tags. A CANCEL constructed by a
   client MUST have only a single Via header field value matching the
   top Via value in the request being cancelled. Using the same values
   for these header fields allows the CANCEL to be matched with the
   request it cancels (Section 9.2 indicates how such matching occurs). However, the method part of the CSeq header field MUST have a value
   of CANCEL. This allows it to be identified and processed as a
   transaction in its own right (See Section 17).
