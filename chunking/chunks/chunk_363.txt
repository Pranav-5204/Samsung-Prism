   5061 for sip: using TLS over TCP and sips: over TCP. (2): The default transport is scheme dependent. For sip:, it is UDP. For sips:, it is TCP. Table 1: Use and default values of URI components for SIP header

   SIP follows the requirements and guidelines of RFC 2396 [5] when
   defining the set of characters that must be escaped in a SIP URI, and
   uses its ""%" HEX HEX" mechanism for escaping. From RFC 2396 [5]:
      The set of characters actually reserved within any given URI
      component is defined by that component. In general, a character
      is reserved if the semantics of the URI changes if the character
      is replaced with its escaped US-ASCII encoding [5]. Excluded US-
      ASCII characters (RFC 2396 [5]), such as space and control
      characters and characters used as URI delimiters, also MUST be
      escaped.
