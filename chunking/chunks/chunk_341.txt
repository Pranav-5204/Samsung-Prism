If a request is destined to an IP address, port, and transport to
   which an existing connection is open, it is RECOMMENDED that this
   connection be used to send the request, but another connection MAY be
   opened and used. If a request is sent using multicast, it is sent to the group
   address, port, and TTL provided by the transport user. If a request
   is sent using unicast unreliable transports, it is sent to the IP
   address and port provided by the transport user. 18.1.2 Receiving Responses
   When a response is received, the client transport examines the top
   Via header field value. If the value of the "sent-by" parameter in
   that header field value does not correspond to a value that the
   client transport is configured to insert into requests, the response
   MUST be silently discarded. If there are any client transactions in existence, the client
   transport uses the matching procedures of Section 17.1.3 to attempt
   to match the response to an existing transaction.
