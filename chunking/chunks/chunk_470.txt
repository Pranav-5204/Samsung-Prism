The UAS SHOULD also determine the subject
   of the certificate (for S/MIME, the SubjectAltName will contain the
   appropriate identity) and compare this value to the From header field    of the request. If the certificate cannot be verified, because it is
   self-signed, or signed by no known authority, or if it is verifiable
   but its subject does not correspond to the From header field of
   request, the UAS MUST notify its user of the status of the
   certificate (including the subject of the certificate, its signer,
   and any key fingerprint information) and request explicit permission
   before proceeding. If the certificate was successfully verified and
   the subject of the certificate corresponds to the From header field
   of the SIP request, or if the user (after notification) explicitly
   authorizes the use of the certificate, the UAS SHOULD add this
   certificate to a local keyring, indexed by the address-of-record of
   the holder of the certificate.
