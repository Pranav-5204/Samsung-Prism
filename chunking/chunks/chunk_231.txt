The proxy MUST NOT reorder field values with a common field
         name (See Section 7.3.1). The proxy MUST NOT add to, modify,
         or remove the message body. An actual implementation need not perform a copy; the primary
         requirement is that the processing for each next hop begin with
         the same request. 2. Request-URI
         The Request-URI in the copy’s start line MUST be replaced with
         the URI for this target. If the URI contains any parameters
         not allowed in a Request-URI, they MUST be removed. This is the essence of a proxy’s role. This is the mechanism
         through which a proxy routes a request toward its destination. In some circumstances, the received Request-URI is placed into
         the target set without being modified. For that target, the
         replacement above is effectively a no-op. 3. Max-Forwards
         If the copy contains a Max-Forwards header field, the proxy
         MUST decrement its value by one (1).
