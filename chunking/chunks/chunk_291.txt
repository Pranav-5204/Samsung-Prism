The transaction exists between the UA or stateful proxy on one side,
   and the UA or stateful proxy on the other side. As far as SIP
   transactions are concerned, stateless proxies are effectively
   transparent. The purpose of the client transaction is to receive a
   request from the element in which the client is embedded (call this
   element the "Transaction User" or TU; it can be a UA or a stateful
   proxy), and reliably deliver the request to a server transaction. The client transaction is also responsible for receiving responses
   and delivering them to the TU, filtering out any response
   retransmissions or disallowed responses (such as a response to ACK). Additionally, in the case of an INVITE request, the client
   transaction is responsible for generating the ACK request for any
   final response accepting a 2xx response. Similarly, the purpose of the server transaction is to receive
   requests from the transport layer and deliver them to the TU.
