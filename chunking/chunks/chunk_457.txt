The Proxy-
   Authorization request-header field allows the client to identify
   itself (or its user) to a proxy that requires authentication. The
   Proxy-Authorization header field value consists of credentials
   containing the authentication information of the UA for the proxy
   and/or realm of the resource being requested. A Proxy-Authorization header field value applies only to the proxy
   whose realm is identified in the "realm" parameter (this proxy may
   previously have demanded authentication using the Proxy-Authenticate
   field). When multiple proxies are used in a chain, a Proxy-
   Authorization header field value MUST NOT be consumed by any proxy
   whose realm does not match the "realm" parameter specified in that
   value.
