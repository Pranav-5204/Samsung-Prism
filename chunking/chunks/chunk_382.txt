A mandatory response header field MUST be present in the
   response, and the header field MUST be understood by the UAC
   processing the response. "Not applicable" means that the header
   field MUST NOT be present in a request. If one is placed in a
   request by mistake, it MUST be ignored by the UAS receiving the
   request. Similarly, a header field labeled "not applicable" for a
   response means that the UAS MUST NOT place the header field in the
   response, and the UAC MUST ignore the header field in the response. A UA SHOULD ignore extension header parameters that are not
   understood. A compact form of some common header field names is also defined for
   use when overall message size is an issue. The Contact, From, and To header fields contain a URI. If the URI
   contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI MUST be
   enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). Any URI parameters are
   contained within these brackets.
