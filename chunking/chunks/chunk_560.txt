It is important to note that the attacker can only leverage this
   vulnerability on the first exchange of keys between two parties - on
   subsequent occasions, the alteration of the key would be noticeable
   to the UAs. It would also be difficult for the attacker to remain in
   the path of all future dialogs between the two parties over time (as
   potentially days, weeks, or years pass). SSH is susceptible to the same man-in-the-middle attack on the first
   exchange of keys; however, it is widely acknowledged that while SSH
   is not perfect, it does improve the security of connections. The use
   of key fingerprints could provide some assistance to SIP, just as it
   does for SSH. For example, if two parties use SIP to establish a
   voice communications session, each could read off the fingerprint of
   the key they received from the other, which could be compared against
   the original.
