Note that if an authentication scheme that does not support realms is
   used in the Proxy-Authorization header field, a proxy server MUST
   attempt to parse all Proxy-Authorization header field values to
   determine whether one of them has what the proxy server considers to
   be valid credentials. Because this is potentially very time-
   consuming in large networks, proxy servers SHOULD use an
   authentication scheme that supports realms in the Proxy-Authorization
   header field. If a request is forked (as described in Section 16.7), various proxy
   servers and/or UAs may wish to challenge the UAC. In this case, the
   forking proxy server is responsible for aggregating these challenges
   into a single response. Each WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate
   value received in responses to the forked request MUST be placed into
   the single response that is sent by the forking proxy to the UA; the
   ordering of these header field values is not significant.
