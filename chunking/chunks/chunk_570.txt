This can apply not only to the
   From and related headers representing the originator of the request,
   but also the To - it may not be appropriate to convey to the final
   destination a speed-dialing nickname, or an unexpanded identifier for
   a group of targets, either of which would be removed from the
   Request-URI as the request is routed, but not changed in the To    header field if the two were initially identical. Thus it MAY be
   desirable for privacy reasons to create a To header field that
   differs from the Request-URI. 27 IANA Considerations
