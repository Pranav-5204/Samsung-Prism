Usually the user will suggest the To
   header field through a human interface, perhaps inputting the URI
   manually or selecting it from some sort of address book. Frequently,
   the user will not enter a complete URI, but rather a string of digits
   or letters (for example, "bob"). It is at the discretion of the UA
   to choose how to interpret this input. Using the string to form the
   user part of a SIP URI implies that the UA wishes the name to be
   resolved in the domain to the right-hand side (RHS) of the at-sign in
   the SIP URI (for instance, sip:bob@example.com). Using the string to
   form the user part of a SIPS URI implies that the UA wishes to
   communicate securely, and that the name is to be resolved in the
   domain to the RHS of the at-sign. The RHS will frequently be the
   home domain of the requestor, which allows for the home domain to
   process the outgoing request.
