These will be echoed in some responses to the
         request such as the 200 (OK) responses to INVITE. Such
         parameters may be useful for keeping state in the message
         rather than the proxy. If a proxy needs to be in the path of any type of dialog (such
         as one straddling a firewall), it SHOULD add a Record-Route
         header field value to every request with a method it does not
         understand since that method may have dialog semantics. The URI a proxy places into a Record-Route header field is only
         valid for the lifetime of any dialog created by the transaction
         in which it occurs. A dialog-stateful proxy, for example, MAY
         refuse to accept future requests with that value in the
         Request-URI after the dialog has terminated.
