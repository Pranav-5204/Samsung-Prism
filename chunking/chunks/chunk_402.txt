The optional "display-name" is meant to be rendered by a human user
   interface. A system SHOULD use the display name "Anonymous" if the
   identity of the client is to remain hidden. Even if the "display-
   name" is empty, the "name-addr" form MUST be used if the "addr-spec"
   contains a comma, question mark, or semicolon. Syntax issues are
   discussed in Section 7.3.1. Two From header fields are equivalent if their URIs match, and their
   parameters match. Extension parameters in one header field, not
   present in the other are ignored for the purposes of comparison. This
   means that the display name and presence or absence of angle brackets
   do not affect matching. See Section 20.10 for the rules for parsing a display name, URI and
   URI parameters, and header field parameters.
