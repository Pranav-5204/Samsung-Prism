If a 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication Required)
   response is received, the UAC SHOULD follow the authorization
   procedures of Section 22.2 and Section 22.3 to retry the request with
   credentials. If a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) response is received (Section
   21.4.11), the request contained a body that was longer than the UAS
   was willing to accept. If possible, the UAC SHOULD retry the
   request, either omitting the body or using one of a smaller length. If a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response is received (Section
   21.4.13), the request contained media types not supported by the UAS. The UAC SHOULD retry sending the request, this time only using
   content with types listed in the Accept header field in the response,
   with encodings listed in the Accept-Encoding header field in the
   response, and with languages listed in the Accept-Language in the
   response.
