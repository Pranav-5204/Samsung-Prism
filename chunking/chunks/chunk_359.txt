An element preparing
         to send a request based on a URI not containing this parameter
         can assume the receiving element implements strict-routing and
         reformat the message to preserve the information in the
         Request-URI. Since the uri-parameter mechanism is extensible, SIP elements
         MUST silently ignore any uri-parameters that they do not
         understand. Headers: Header fields to be included in a request constructed
         from the URI. Headers fields in the SIP request can be specified with the "?" mechanism within a URI. The header names and values are
         encoded in ampersand separated hname = hvalue pairs. The
         special hname "body" indicates that the associated hvalue is
         the message-body of the SIP request. Table 1 summarizes the use of SIP and SIPS URI components based on
   the context in which the URI appears.
