If the UAS recognizes
   but does not support the method of a request, it MUST generate a 405
   (Method Not Allowed) response. Procedures for generating responses
   are described in Section 8.2.6. The UAS MUST also add an Allow
   header field to the 405 (Method Not Allowed) response. The Allow
   header field MUST list the set of methods supported by the UAS
   generating the message. The Allow header field is presented in
   Section 20.5. If the method is one supported by the server, processing continues. 8.2.2 Header Inspection
   If a UAS does not understand a header field in a request (that is,
   the header field is not defined in this specification or in any
   supported extension), the server MUST ignore that header field and
   continue processing the message. A UAS SHOULD ignore any malformed
   header fields that are not necessary for processing requests.
