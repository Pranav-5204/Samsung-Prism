It allows endpoints that cannot resolve the first Route
      URI to delegate that task to an outbound proxy. The UAC SHOULD follow the procedures defined in [4] for stateful
   elements, trying each address until a server is contacted. Each try
   constitutes a new transaction, and therefore each carries a different
   topmost Via header field value with a new branch parameter. Furthermore, the transport value in the Via header field is set to
   whatever transport was determined for the target server. 8.1.3 Processing Responses
   Responses are first processed by the transport layer and then passed
   up to the transaction layer. The transaction layer performs its
   processing and then passes the response up to the TU. The majority
   of response processing in the TU is method specific. However, there
   are some general behaviors independent of the method.
