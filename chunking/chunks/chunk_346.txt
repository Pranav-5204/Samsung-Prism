18.2.2 Sending Responses
   The server transport uses the value of the top Via header field in
   order to determine where to send a response. It MUST follow the
   following process:
      o  If the "sent-protocol" is a reliable transport protocol such as
         TCP or SCTP, or TLS over those, the response MUST be sent using
         the existing connection to the source of the original request
         that created the transaction, if that connection is still open. This requires the server transport to maintain an association
         between server transactions and transport connections. If that
         connection is no longer open, the server SHOULD open a
         connection to the IP address in the "received" parameter, if
         present, using the port in the "sent-by" value, or the default
         port for that transport, if no port is specified.
