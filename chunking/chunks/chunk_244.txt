Thus, the branch parameter provided with the Via
         header field inserted in step 8 MUST be different for each
         attempt. If the client transaction reports failure to send the request
         or a timeout from its state machine, the proxy continues to the
         next address in that ordered set. If the ordered set is
         exhausted, the request cannot be forwarded to this element in
         the target set. The proxy does not need to place anything in
         the response context, but otherwise acts as if this element of
         the target set returned a 408 (Request Timeout) final response. 8. Add a Via header field value
         The proxy MUST insert a Via header field value into the copy
         before the existing Via header field values. The construction
         of this value follows the same guidelines of Section 8.1.1.7.
