Otherwise, the proxy MUST apply
         the procedures to the first value in the Route header field, if
         present, else the Request-URI. The procedures will produce an
         ordered set of (address, port, transport) tuples. Independently of which URI is being used as input to the
         procedures of [4], if the Request-URI specifies a SIPS
         resource, the proxy MUST follow the procedures of [4] as if the
         input URI were a SIPS URI. As described in [4], the proxy MUST attempt to deliver the
         message to the first tuple in that set, and proceed through the
         set in order until the delivery attempt succeeds. For each tuple attempted, the proxy MUST format the message as
         appropriate for the tuple and send the request using a new
         client transaction as detailed in steps 8 through 10. Since each attempt uses a new client transaction, it represents
         a new branch.
