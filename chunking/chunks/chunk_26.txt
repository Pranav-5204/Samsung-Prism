Authorization and authentication are handled in
   SIP either on a request-by-request basis with a challenge/response
   mechanism, or by using a lower layer scheme as discussed in Section
   26. The complete set of SIP message details for this registration example
   is in Section 24.1. Additional operations in SIP, such as querying for the capabilities
   of a SIP server or client using OPTIONS, or canceling a pending
   request using CANCEL, will be introduced in later sections. 5 Structure of the Protocol
   SIP is structured as a layered protocol, which means that its
   behavior is described in terms of a set of fairly independent
   processing stages with only a loose coupling between each stage. The
   protocol behavior is described as layers for the purpose of
   presentation, allowing the description of functions common across
   elements in a single section. It does not dictate an implementation
   in any way.
