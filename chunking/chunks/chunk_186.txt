If the dialog identifier in the 2xx response matches the dialog
   identifier of an existing dialog, the dialog MUST be transitioned to
   the "confirmed" state, and the route set for the dialog MUST be
   recomputed based on the 2xx response using the procedures of Section
   12.2.1.2. Otherwise, a new dialog in the "confirmed" state MUST be
   constructed using the procedures of Section 12.1.2. Note that the only piece of state that is recomputed is the route
      set. Other pieces of state such as the highest sequence numbers
      (remote and local) sent within the dialog are not recomputed. The
      route set only is recomputed for backwards compatibility. RFC
      2543 did not mandate mirroring of the Record-Route header field in
      a 1xx, only 2xx. However, we cannot update the entire state of
      the dialog, since mid-dialog requests may have been sent within
      the early dialog, modifying the sequence numbers, for example.
