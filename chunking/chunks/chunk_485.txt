Primarily, a user agent will want to encrypt header fields that have
   an end-to-end semantic, including: Subject, Reply-To, Organization,
   Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Alert-Info, Error-Info,
   Authentication-Info, Expires, In-Reply-To, Require, Supported,
   Unsupported, Retry-After, User-Agent, Server, and Warning. If any of
   these header fields are present in an encrypted body, they should be
   used instead of any "outer" header fields, whether this entails
   displaying the header field values to users or setting internal
   states in the UA. They SHOULD NOT however be used in the "outer"
   headers of any future messages. If present, the Date header field MUST always be the same in the
   "inner" and "outer" headers. Since MIME bodies are attached to the "inner" message,
   implementations will usually encrypt MIME-specific header fields,
   including: MIME-Version, Content-Type, Content-Length, Content-
   Language, Content-Encoding and Content-Disposition.
