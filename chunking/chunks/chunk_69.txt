When a pre-existing route set is present, the procedures for
   populating the Request-URI and Route header field detailed in Section
   12.2.1.1 MUST be followed (even though there is no dialog), using the
   desired Request-URI as the remote target URI. 8.1.1.2 To
   The To header field first and foremost specifies the desired
   "logical" recipient of the request, or the address-of-record of the
   user or resource that is the target of this request. This may or may
   not be the ultimate recipient of the request. The To header field
   MAY contain a SIP or SIPS URI, but it may also make use of other URI
   schemes (the tel URL (RFC 2806 [9]), for example) when appropriate. All SIP implementations MUST support the SIP URI scheme. Any
   implementation that supports TLS MUST support the SIPS URI scheme. The To header field allows for a display name. A UAC may learn how to populate the To header field for a particular
   request in a number of ways.
