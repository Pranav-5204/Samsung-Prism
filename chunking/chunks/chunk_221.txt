Proxy-Authorization check
      If an element requires credentials before forwarding a request,
      the request MUST be inspected as described in Section 22.3. That
      section also defines what the element must do if the inspection
      fails. 16.4 Route Information Preprocessing
   The proxy MUST inspect the Request-URI of the request. If the
   Request-URI of the request contains a value this proxy previously
   placed into a Record-Route header field (see Section 16.6 item 4),
   the proxy MUST replace the Request-URI in the request with the last
   value from the Route header field, and remove that value from the
   Route header field. The proxy MUST then proceed as if it received
   this modified request. This will only happen when the element sending the request to the
      proxy (which may have been an endpoint) is a strict router. This
      rewrite on receive is necessary to enable backwards compatibility
      with those elements.
