If a response context is not found, the element does not have any
   knowledge of the request to apply the CANCEL to. It MUST statelessly
   forward the CANCEL request (it may have statelessly forwarded the
   associated request previously). 16.11 Stateless Proxy
   When acting statelessly, a proxy is a simple message forwarder. Much
   of the processing performed when acting statelessly is the same as
   when behaving statefully. The differences are detailed here. A stateless proxy does not have any notion of a transaction, or of
   the response context used to describe stateful proxy behavior. Instead, the stateless proxy takes messages, both requests and
   responses, directly from the transport layer (See section 18). As a
   result, stateless proxies do not retransmit messages on their own. They do, however, forward all retransmissions they receive (they do
   not have the ability to distinguish a retransmission from the
   original message).
