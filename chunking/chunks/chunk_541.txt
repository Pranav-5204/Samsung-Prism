If a UA holds one or more root certificates of certificate
   authorities in order to validate certificates for TLS or IPSec, it
   SHOULD be capable of reusing these to verify S/MIME certificates, as
   appropriate. A UA MAY hold root certificates specifically for
   validating S/MIME certificates. Note that is it anticipated that future security extensions may
      upgrade the normative strength associated with S/MIME as S/MIME
      implementations appear and the problem space becomes better
      understood. 26.3.2 Security Solutions
   The operation of these security mechanisms in concert can follow the
   existing web and email security models to some degree. At a high
   level, UAs authenticate themselves to servers (proxy servers,
   redirect servers, and registrars) with a Digest username and
   password; servers authenticate themselves to UAs one hop away, or to
   another server one hop away (and vice versa), with a site certificate
   delivered by TLS.
