Syntax and semantics follow those specified in RFC 2617 [17]. Example:
      Authentication-Info: nextnonce="47364c23432d2e131a5fb210812c"
20.7 Authorization
   The Authorization header field contains authentication credentials of
   a UA. Section 22.2 overviews the use of the Authorization header
   field, and Section 22.4 describes the syntax and semantics when used
   with HTTP authentication. This header field, along with Proxy-Authorization, breaks the general
   rules about multiple header field values. Although not a comma-
   separated list, this header field name may be present multiple times,
   and MUST NOT be combined into a single header line using the usual
   rules described in Section 7.3.
