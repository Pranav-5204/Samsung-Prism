8.1.1.5 CSeq
   The CSeq header field serves as a way to identify and order
   transactions. It consists of a sequence number and a method. The
   method MUST match that of the request. For non-REGISTER requests
   outside of a dialog, the sequence number value is arbitrary. The
   sequence number value MUST be expressible as a 32-bit unsigned
   integer and MUST be less than 2**31. As long as it follows the above
   guidelines, a client may use any mechanism it would like to select
   CSeq header field values. Section 12.2.1.1 discusses construction of the CSeq for requests
   within a dialog. Example:
      CSeq: 4711 INVITE
8.1.1.6 Max-Forwards
   The Max-Forwards header field serves to limit the number of hops a
   request can transit on the way to its destination. It consists of an
   integer that is decremented by one at each hop.
