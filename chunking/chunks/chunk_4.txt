SIP is
   rather a component that can be used with other IETF protocols to
   build a complete multimedia architecture. Typically, these
   architectures will include protocols such as the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) (RFC 1889 [28]) for transporting real-time data and
   providing QoS feedback, the Real-Time streaming protocol (RTSP) (RFC
   2326 [29]) for controlling delivery of streaming media, the Media    Gateway Control Protocol (MEGACO) (RFC 3015 [30]) for controlling
   gateways to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327 [1]) for describing
   multimedia sessions. Therefore, SIP should be used in conjunction
   with other protocols in order to provide complete services to the
   users. However, the basic functionality and operation of SIP does
   not depend on any of these protocols. SIP does not provide services. Rather, SIP provides primitives that
   can be used to implement different services.
