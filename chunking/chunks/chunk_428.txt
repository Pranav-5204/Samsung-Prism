Formats for such bodies are not defined here, and may be
   the subject of future standardization. 21.4 Request Failure 4xx
   4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular
   server. The client SHOULD NOT retry the same request without
   modification (for example, adding appropriate authorization). However, the same request to a different server might be successful. 21.4.1 400 Bad Request
   The request could not be understood due to malformed syntax. The
   Reason-Phrase SHOULD identify the syntax problem in more detail, for
   example, "Missing Call-ID header field". 21.4.2 401 Unauthorized
   The request requires user authentication. This response is issued by
   UASs and registrars, while 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) is
   used by proxy servers. 21.4.3 402 Payment Required
   Reserved for future use. 21.4.4 403 Forbidden
   The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help, and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
