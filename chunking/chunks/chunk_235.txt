This proxy, in general, has no way
         of knowing the capabilities of that element, so it must
         restrict itself to the mandatory elements of a SIP
         implementation: SIP URIs and either the TCP or UDP transports. The URI placed in the Record-Route header field MUST resolve to
         the element inserting it (or a suitable stand-in) when the
         server location procedures of [4] are applied to it, so that
         subsequent requests reach the same SIP element. If the
         Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, or the topmost Route header
         field value (after the post processing of bullet 6) contains a
         SIPS URI, the URI placed into the Record-Route header field
         MUST be a SIPS URI. Furthermore, if the request was not
         received over TLS, the proxy MUST insert a Record-Route header
         field.
