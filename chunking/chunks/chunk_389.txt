In the example below, there are no quotes around the Digest
   parameter:
      Authorization: Digest username="Alice", realm="atlanta.com",
       nonce="84a4cc6f3082121f32b42a2187831a9e",
       response="7587245234b3434cc3412213e5f113a5432"
20.8 Call-ID
   The Call-ID header field uniquely identifies a particular invitation
   or all registrations of a particular client. A single multimedia
   conference can give rise to several calls with different Call-IDs,
   for example, if a user invites a single individual several times to
   the same (long-running) conference. Call-IDs are case-sensitive and
   are simply compared byte-by-byte. The compact form of the Call-ID header field is i. Examples:
      Call-ID: f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@biloxi.com
      i:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@192.0.2.4
20.9 Call-Info
   The Call-Info header field provides additional information about the
   caller or callee, depending on whether it is found in a request or
   response.
