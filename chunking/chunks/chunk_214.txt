The next several subsections are written
   from the point of view of a stateful proxy. The last section calls
   out those places where a stateless proxy behaves differently. 16.2 Stateful Proxy
   When stateful, a proxy is purely a SIP transaction processing engine. Its behavior is modeled here in terms of the server and client
   transactions defined in Section 17. A stateful proxy has a server
   transaction associated with one or more client transactions by a
   higher layer proxy processing component (see figure 3), known as a
   proxy core. An incoming request is processed by a server    transaction. Requests from the server transaction are passed to a
   proxy core. The proxy core determines where to route the request,
   choosing one or more next-hop locations. An outgoing request for
   each next-hop location is processed by its own associated client
   transaction.
