The Request-URI MUST NOT contain unescaped spaces or control
           characters and MUST NOT be enclosed in "<>". SIP elements MAY support Request-URIs with schemes other than
           "sip" and "sips", for example the "tel" URI scheme of RFC
           2806 [9]. SIP elements MAY translate non-SIP URIs using any
           mechanism at their disposal, resulting in SIP URI, SIPS URI,
           or some other scheme. SIP-Version: Both request and response messages include the
           version of SIP in use, and follow [H3.1] (with HTTP replaced
           by SIP, and HTTP/1.1 replaced by SIP/2.0) regarding version
           ordering, compliance requirements, and upgrading of version
           numbers. To be compliant with this specification,
           applications sending SIP messages MUST include a SIP-Version
           of "SIP/2.0". The SIP-Version string is case-insensitive,
           but implementations MUST send upper-case.
