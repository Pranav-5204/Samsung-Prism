Furthermore, comparison rules were
      simplified to be primarily case-insensitive, and detailed handling
      of comparison in the presence of parameters was described. The
      most substantial change is that a URI with a parameter with the
      default value does not match a URI without that parameter. o  Removed Via hiding. It had serious trust issues, since it relied
      on the next hop to perform the obfuscation process. Instead, Via
      hiding can be done as a local implementation choice in stateful
      proxies, and thus is no longer documented. o  In RFC 2543, CANCEL and INVITE transactions were intermingled. They are separated now. When a user sends an INVITE and then a
      CANCEL, the INVITE transaction still terminates normally. A UAS
      needs to respond to the original INVITE request with a 487
      response. o  Similarly, CANCEL and BYE transactions were intermingled; RFC 2543
      allowed the UAS not to send a response to INVITE when a BYE was
      received.
