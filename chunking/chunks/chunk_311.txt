If a
   provisional response is received while in the "Trying" state, the
   response MUST be passed to the TU, and then the client transaction
   SHOULD move to the "Proceeding" state. If a final response (status
   codes 200-699) is received while in the "Trying" state, the response
   MUST be passed to the TU, and the client transaction MUST transition
   to the "Completed" state. If Timer E fires while in the "Proceeding" state, the request MUST be
   passed to the transport layer for retransmission, and Timer E MUST be
   reset with a value of T2 seconds. If timer F fires while in the
   "Proceeding" state, the TU MUST be informed of a timeout, and the
   client transaction MUST transition to the terminated state. If a
   final response (status codes 200-699) is received while in the
   "Proceeding" state, the response MUST be passed to the TU, and the
   client transaction MUST transition to the "Completed" state.
