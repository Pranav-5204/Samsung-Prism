The Accept header field
   is especially useful for indicating support of various session
   description formats. The UAC MAY add an Expires header field (Section 20.19) to limit the
   validity of the invitation. If the time indicated in the Expires
   header field is reached and no final answer for the INVITE has been
   received, the UAC core SHOULD generate a CANCEL request for the
   INVITE, as per Section 9. A UAC MAY also find it useful to add, among others, Subject (Section
   20.36), Organization (Section 20.25) and User-Agent (Section 20.41)
   header fields. They all contain information related to the INVITE. The UAC MAY choose to add a message body to the INVITE. Section
   8.1.1.10 deals with how to construct the header fields -- Content-
   Type among others -- needed to describe the message body. There are special rules for message bodies that contain a session
   description - their corresponding Content-Disposition is "session".
