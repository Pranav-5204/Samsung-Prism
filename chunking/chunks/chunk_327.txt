While in the "Completed" state, the
   server transaction MUST pass the final response to the transport
   layer for retransmission whenever a retransmission of the request is
   received. Any other final responses passed by the TU to the server
   transaction MUST be discarded while in the "Completed" state. The
   server transaction remains in this state until Timer J fires, at
   which point it MUST transition to the "Terminated" state. The server transaction MUST be destroyed the instant it enters the
   "Terminated" state. 17.2.3 Matching Requests to Server Transactions
   When a request is received from the network by the server, it has to
   be matched to an existing transaction. This is accomplished in the
   following manner. The branch parameter in the topmost Via header field of the request
   is examined. If it is present and begins with the magic cookie
   "z9hG4bK", the request was generated by a client transaction
   compliant to this specification.
