If the From tag,
   Call-ID, and CSeq exactly match those associated with an ongoing
   transaction, but the request does not match that transaction (based
   on the matching rules in Section 17.2.3), the UAS core SHOULD
   generate a 482 (Loop Detected) response and pass it to the server
   transaction. The same request has arrived at the UAS more than once, following
      different paths, most likely due to forking. The UAS processes
      the first such request received and responds with a 482 (Loop
      Detected) to the rest of them. 8.2.2.3 Require
   Assuming the UAS decides that it is the proper element to process the
   request, it examines the Require header field, if present. The Require header field is used by a UAC to tell a UAS about SIP
   extensions that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to
   process the request properly. Its format is described in Section
   20.32.
