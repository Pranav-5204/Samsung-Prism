If the
   first element in the route set indicated a strict router (resulting
   in forming the request as described in Section 12.2.1.1), the
   procedures MUST be applied to the Request-URI of the request. Otherwise, the procedures are applied to the first Route header field
   value in the request (if one exists), or to the requestâ€™s Request-URI
   if there is no Route header field present. These procedures yield an
   ordered set of address, port, and transports to attempt. Independent
   of which URI is used as input to the procedures of [4], if the
   Request-URI specifies a SIPS resource, the UAC MUST follow the
   procedures of [4] as if the input URI were a SIPS URI. Local policy MAY specify an alternate set of destinations to attempt. If the Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, any alternate destinations
   MUST be contacted with TLS. Beyond that, there are no restrictions
   on the alternate destinations if the request contains no Route header
   field.
