All SIP elements that support TLS MUST also support the SIPS URI
   scheme. Proxy servers, redirect servers, registrars, and UAs MAY also
   implement IPSec or other lower-layer security protocols. When a UA attempts to contact a proxy server, redirect server, or
   registrar, the UAC SHOULD initiate a TLS connection over which it
   will send SIP messages. In some architectures, UASs MAY receive
   requests over such TLS connections as well. Proxy servers, redirect servers, registrars, and UAs MUST implement
   Digest Authorization, encompassing all of the aspects required in 22. Proxy servers, redirect servers, and registrars SHOULD be configured
   with at least one Digest realm, and at least one "realm" string
   supported by a given server SHOULD correspond to the serverâ€™s
   hostname or domainname. UAs MAY support the signing and encrypting of MIME bodies, and
   transference of credentials with S/MIME as described in Section 23.
