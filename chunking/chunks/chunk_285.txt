It then prepares to
   send the request based on the now first Route header field value of
   sip:p3.middle.com, but it notices that this URI does not contain the
   lr parameter, so before sending, it reformats the request to be:
      BYE sip:p3.middle.com SIP/2.0
      Route: <sip:p2.example.com;lr>
      Route: <sip:p1.example.com;lr>
      Route: <sip:caller@u1.example.com>
   P3 is a strict router, so it forwards the following to P2:
      BYE sip:p2.example.com;lr SIP/2.0
      Route: <sip:p1.example.com;lr>
      Route: <sip:caller@u1.example.com>
   P2 sees the request-URI is a value it placed into a Record-Route
   header field, so before further processing, it rewrites the request
   to be:
      BYE sip:caller@u1.example.com SIP/2.0
      Route: <sip:p1.example.com;lr>
   P2 is not responsible for u1.example.com, so it sends the request to
   P1 based on the resolution of the Route header field value.
