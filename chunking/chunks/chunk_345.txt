Before passing the request up, the transport adds a "received"
   parameter, so that the request would look like, in part:
      INVITE sip:bob@Biloxi.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060;received=192.0.2.4
   Next, the server transport attempts to match the request to a server
   transaction. It does so using the matching rules described in
   Section 17.2.3. If a matching server transaction is found, the
   request is passed to that transaction for processing. If no match is
   found, the request is passed to the core, which may decide to
   construct a new server transaction for that request. Note that when
   a UAS core sends a 2xx response to INVITE, the server transaction is
   destroyed. This means that when the ACK arrives, there will be no
   matching server transaction, and based on this rule, the ACK is
   passed to the UAS core, where it is processed.
