For example, before
   a client inserts a Require header field into an INVITE listing an
   option that it is not certain the destination UAS supports, the
   client can query the destination UAS with an OPTIONS to see if this
   option is returned in a Supported header field. All UAs MUST support
   the OPTIONS method. The target of the OPTIONS request is identified by the Request-URI,
   which could identify another UA or a SIP server. If the OPTIONS is
   addressed to a proxy server, the Request-URI is set without a user
   part, similar to the way a Request-URI is set for a REGISTER request. Alternatively, a server receiving an OPTIONS request with a Max-
   Forwards header field value of 0 MAY respond to the request
   regardless of the Request-URI. This behavior is common with HTTP/1.1.
