Usually, the value that populates the From header field in requests
   generated by a particular UA is pre-provisioned by the user or by the
   administrators of the userâ€™s local domain. If a particular UA is
   used by multiple users, it might have switchable profiles that
   include a URI corresponding to the identity of the profiled user. Recipients of requests can authenticate the originator of a request
   in order to ascertain that they are who their From header field
   claims they are (see Section 22 for more on authentication). The From field MUST contain a new "tag" parameter, chosen by the UAC. See Section 19.3 for details on choosing a tag. For further information on the From header field, see Section 20.20.
