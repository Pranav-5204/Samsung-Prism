A request may
   traverse several proxies on its way to a UAS. Each will make routing
   decisions, modifying the request before forwarding it to the next
   element. Responses will route through the same set of proxies
   traversed by the request in the reverse order. Being a proxy is a logical role for a SIP element. When a request
   arrives, an element that can play the role of a proxy first decides
   if it needs to respond to the request on its own. For instance, the
   request may be malformed or the element may need credentials from the
   client before acting as a proxy. The element MAY respond with any    appropriate error code. When responding directly to a request, the
   element is playing the role of a UAS and MUST behave as described in
   Section 8.2. A proxy can operate in either a stateful or stateless mode for each
   new request. When stateless, a proxy acts as a simple forwarding
   element.
