Specifically, LWS on either side of the
   ":" or "/" is allowed, as shown here:
      Via: SIP / 2.0 / UDP first.example.com: 4000;ttl=16
        ;maddr=224.2.0.1 ;branch=z9hG4bKa7c6a8dlze.1
   Even though this specification mandates that the branch parameter be
   present in all requests, the BNF for the header field indicates that
   it is optional. This allows interoperation with RFC 2543 elements,
   which did not have to insert the branch parameter. Two Via header fields are equal if their sent-protocol and sent-by
   fields are equal, both have the same set of parameters, and the
   values of all parameters are equal. 20.43 Warning
   The Warning header field is used to carry additional information
   about the status of a response. Warning header field values are sent
   with responses and contain a three-digit warning code, host name, and
   warning text.
