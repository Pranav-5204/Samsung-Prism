When a UAC receives a 2xx response to a target refresh request, it
   MUST replace the dialogâ€™s remote target URI with the URI from the
   Contact header field in that response, if present. If the response for a request within a dialog is a 481
   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) or a 408 (Request Timeout), the UAC
   SHOULD terminate the dialog. A UAC SHOULD also terminate a dialog if
   no response at all is received for the request (the client
   transaction would inform the TU about the timeout.) For INVITE initiated dialogs, terminating the dialog consists of
      sending a BYE. 12.2.2 UAS Behavior
   Requests sent within a dialog, as any other requests, are atomic. If
   a particular request is accepted by the UAS, all the state changes
   associated with it are performed. If the request is rejected, none
   of the state changes are performed. Note that some requests, such as INVITEs, affect several pieces of
      state. The UAS will receive the request from the transaction layer.
