If a request is sent via multicast, it is possible that it will
   generate multiple responses from different servers. These responses
   will all have the same branch parameter in the topmost Via, but vary
   in the To tag. The first response received, based on the rules
   above, will be used, and others will be viewed as retransmissions. That is not an error; multicast SIP provides only a rudimentary
   "single-hop-discovery-like" service that is limited to processing a
   single response. See Section 18.1.1 for details.
