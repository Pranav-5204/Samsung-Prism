Users may wish to find an alternate
   means to contact the other party and confirm that their key has
   legitimately changed. Note that users are sometimes compelled to
   change their certificates, for example when they suspect that the
   secrecy of their private key has been compromised. When their
   private key is no longer private, users must legitimately generate a
   new key and re-establish trust with any users that held their old
   key. Finally, if during the course of a dialog a UA receives a certificate
   in a CMS SignedData message that does not correspond with the
   certificates previously exchanged during a dialog, the UA MUST notify
   its user of the change, preferably in terms that indicate that this
   is a potential security breach. 23.3 Securing MIME bodies
   There are two types of secure MIME bodies that are of interest to
   SIP: use of these bodies should follow the S/MIME specification [24]
   with a few variations.
