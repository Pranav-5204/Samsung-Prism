When resubmitting its request in response to a 401 (Unauthorized) or
   407 (Proxy Authentication Required) that contains multiple
   challenges, a UAC MAY include an Authorization value for each WWW-
   Authenticate value and a Proxy-Authorization value for each Proxy-
   Authenticate value for which the UAC wishes to supply a credential. As noted above, multiple credentials in a request SHOULD be
   differentiated by the "realm" parameter. It is possible for multiple challenges associated with the same realm
   to appear in the same 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication
   Required). This can occur, for example, when multiple proxies within
   the same administrative domain, which use a common realm, are reached
   by a forking request. When it retries a request, a UAC MAY therefore
   supply multiple credentials in Authorization or Proxy-Authorization
   header fields with the same "realm" parameter value. The same
   credentials SHOULD be used for the same realm.
