The biloxi.com proxy server adds
   another Via header field value with its own address to the INVITE and
   proxies it to Bob’s SIP phone. Bob’s SIP phone receives the INVITE and alerts Bob to the incoming
   call from Alice so that Bob can decide whether to answer the call,
   that is, Bob’s phone rings. Bob’s SIP phone indicates this in a 180
   (Ringing) response, which is routed back through the two proxies in
   the reverse direction. Each proxy uses the Via header field to
   determine where to send the response and removes its own address from
   the top. As a result, although DNS and location service lookups were
   required to route the initial INVITE, the 180 (Ringing) response can
   be returned to the caller without lookups or without state being    maintained in the proxies. This also has the desirable property that
   each proxy that sees the INVITE will also see all responses to the
   INVITE.
