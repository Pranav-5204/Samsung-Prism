21.4.22 484 Address Incomplete
   The server received a request with a Request-URI that was incomplete. Additional information SHOULD be provided in the reason phrase. This status code allows overlapped dialing. With overlapped
      dialing, the client does not know the length of the dialing
      string. It sends strings of increasing lengths, prompting the
      user for more input, until it no longer receives a 484 (Address
      Incomplete) status response. 21.4.23 485 Ambiguous
   The Request-URI was ambiguous. The response MAY contain a listing of
   possible unambiguous addresses in Contact header fields. Revealing
   alternatives can infringe on privacy of the user or the organization. It MUST be possible to configure a server to respond with status 404
   (Not Found) or to suppress the listing of possible choices for
   ambiguous Request-URIs.
