For example,
   both his SIP phone at home and the one in the office could send
   registrations. This information is stored together in the location    service and allows a proxy to perform various types of searches to
   locate Bob. Similarly, more than one user can be registered on a
   single device at the same time. The location service is just an abstract concept. It generally
   contains information that allows a proxy to input a URI and receive a
   set of zero or more URIs that tell the proxy where to send the
   request. Registrations are one way to create this information, but
   not the only way. Arbitrary mapping functions can be configured at
   the discretion of the administrator. Finally, it is important to note that in SIP, registration is used
   for routing incoming SIP requests and has no role in authorizing
   outgoing requests.
