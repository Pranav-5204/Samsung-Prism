For each target, the proxy forwards the request following these
   steps:
      1. Make a copy of the received request
      2. Update the Request-URI
      3. Update the Max-Forwards header field
      4. Optionally add a Record-route header field value
      5. Optionally add additional header fields
      6. Postprocess routing information
      7. Determine the next-hop address, port, and transport
      8. Add a Via header field value
      9. Add a Content-Length header field if necessary
      10. Forward the new request
      11. Set timer C
   Each of these steps is detailed below:
      1. Copy request
         The proxy starts with a copy of the received request. The copy
         MUST initially contain all of the header fields from the
         received request. Fields not detailed in the processing
         described below MUST NOT be removed. The copy SHOULD maintain
         the ordering of the header fields as in the received request.
