o  Senders of S/MIME bodies SHOULD use the "SMIMECapabilities"
         (see Section 2.5.2 of [24]) attribute to express their
         capabilities and preferences for further communications. Note
         especially that senders MAY use the "preferSignedData"          capability to encourage receivers to respond with CMS
         SignedData messages (for example, when sending an OPTIONS
         request as described above). o  S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support SHA1 as a
         digital signature algorithm, and 3DES as an encryption
         algorithm. All other signature and encryption algorithms MAY
         be supported. Implementations can negotiate support for these
         algorithms with the "SMIMECapabilities" attribute. o  Each S/MIME body in a SIP message SHOULD be signed with only
         one certificate. If a UA receives a message with multiple
         signatures, the outermost signature should be treated as the
         single certificate for this body.
