Specifically, a
   SIP transaction consists of a single request and any responses to
   that request, which include zero or more provisional responses and
   one or more final responses. In the case of a transaction where the
   request was an INVITE (known as an INVITE transaction), the
   transaction also includes the ACK only if the final response was not
   a 2xx response. If the response was a 2xx, the ACK is not considered
   part of the transaction. The reason for this separation is rooted in the importance of
      delivering all 200 (OK) responses to an INVITE to the UAC. To
      deliver them all to the UAC, the UAS alone takes responsibility       for retransmitting them (see Section 13.3.1.4), and the UAC alone
      takes responsibility for acknowledging them with ACK (see Section
      13.2.2.4). Since this ACK is retransmitted only by the UAC, it is
      effectively considered its own transaction. Transactions have a client side and a server side.
