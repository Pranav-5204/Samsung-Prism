If there is no configured
   registrar address, the UA SHOULD use the host part of the address-
   of-record as the Request-URI and address the request there, using the
   normal SIP server location mechanisms [4]. For example, the UA for
   the user "sip:carol@chicago.com" addresses the REGISTER request to
   "sip:chicago.com". Finally, a UA can be configured to use multicast. Multicast
   registrations are addressed to the well-known "all SIP servers"
   multicast address "sip.mcast.net" (224.0.1.75 for IPv4). No well-
   known IPv6 multicast address has been allocated; such an allocation
   will be documented separately when needed. SIP UAs MAY listen to
   that address and use it to become aware of the location of other
   local users (see [33]); however, they do not respond to the request. Multicast registration may be inappropriate in some environments,
      for example, if multiple businesses share the same local area
      network.
