If self-
   signed certificates (or certificates that cannot be verified by one
   of the participants in a dialog) are used, the SIP-based key exchange
   mechanism described in Section 23.2 is susceptible to a man-in-the-
   middle attack with which an attacker can potentially inspect and
   modify S/MIME bodies. The attacker needs to intercept the first
   exchange of keys between the two parties in a dialog, remove the
   existing CMS-detached signatures from the request and response, and
   insert a different CMS-detached signature containing a certificate
   supplied by the attacker (but which seems to be a certificate for the
   proper address-of-record). Each party will think they have exchanged
   keys with the other, when in fact each has the public key of the
   attacker.
