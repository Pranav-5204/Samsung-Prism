The Contact header field contains an address where the
   UAS would like to be contacted for subsequent requests in the dialog
   (which includes the ACK for a 2xx response in the case of an INVITE). Generally, the host portion of this URI is the IP address or FQDN of
   the host. The URI provided in the Contact header field MUST be a SIP
   or SIPS URI. If the request that initiated the dialog contained a    SIPS URI in the Request-URI or in the top Record-Route header field
   value, if there was any, or the Contact header field if there was no
   Record-Route header field, the Contact header field in the response
   MUST be a SIPS URI. The URI SHOULD have global scope (that is, the
   same URI can be used in messages outside this dialog). The same way,
   the scope of the URI in the Contact header field of the INVITE is not
   limited to this dialog either. It can therefore be used in messages
   to the UAC even outside this dialog. The UAS then constructs the state of the dialog.
