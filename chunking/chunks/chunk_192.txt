13.3.1.1 Progress
   If the UAS is not able to answer the invitation immediately, it can
   choose to indicate some kind of progress to the UAC (for example, an
   indication that a phone is ringing). This is accomplished with a
   provisional response between 101 and 199. These provisional
   responses establish early dialogs and therefore follow the procedures
   of Section 12.1.1 in addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A UAS MAY
   send as many provisional responses as it likes. Each of these MUST
   indicate the same dialog ID. However, these will not be delivered
   reliably. If the UAS desires an extended period of time to answer the INVITE,
   it will need to ask for an "extension" in order to prevent proxies
   from canceling the transaction. A proxy has the option of canceling
   a transaction when there is a gap of 3 minutes between responses in a
   transaction.
