Bodies are signed with the
   private key of the sender (who may include their public key with the
   message as appropriate), but bodies are encrypted with the public key
   of the intended recipient. Obviously, senders must have
   foreknowledge of the public key of recipients in order to encrypt
   message bodies. Public keys can be stored within a UA on a virtual
   keyring. Each user agent that supports S/MIME MUST contain a keyring
   specifically for end-usersâ€™ certificates. This keyring should map
   between addresses of record and corresponding certificates. Over
   time, users SHOULD use the same certificate when they populate the
   originating URI of signaling (the From header field) with the same
   address-of-record. Any mechanisms depending on the existence of end-user certificates
   are seriously limited in that there is virtually no consolidated
   authority today that provides certificates for end-user applications.
