Example:
      UAC->UAS:   INVITE sip:watson@bell-telephone.com SIP/2.0
                  Require: 100rel
      UAS->UAC:   SIP/2.0 420 Bad Extension
                  Unsupported: 100rel
      This behavior ensures that the client-server interaction will
      proceed without delay when all options are understood by both
      sides, and only slow down if options are not understood (as in the
      example above). For a well-matched client-server pair, the
      interaction proceeds quickly, saving a round-trip often required
      by negotiation mechanisms. In addition, it also removes ambiguity
      when the client requires features that the server does not
      understand. Some features, such as call handling fields, are only
      of interest to end systems. 8.2.3 Content Processing
   Assuming the UAS understands any extensions required by the client,
   the UAS examines the body of the message, and the header fields that
   describe it.
