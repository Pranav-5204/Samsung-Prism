Reasonable Syntax
      2. URI scheme
      3. Max-Forwards
      4. (Optional) Loop Detection
      5. Proxy-Require
      6. Proxy-Authorization
   If any of these checks fail, the element MUST behave as a user agent
   server (see Section 8.2) and respond with an error code. Notice that a proxy is not required to detect merged requests and
   MUST NOT treat merged requests as an error condition. The endpoints
   receiving the requests will resolve the merge as described in Section
   8.2.2.2. 1. Reasonable syntax check
      The request MUST be well-formed enough to be handled with a server
      transaction. Any components involved in the remainder of these
      Request Validation steps or the Request Forwarding section MUST be
      well-formed. Any other components, well-formed or not, SHOULD be
      ignored and remain unchanged when the message is forwarded. For
      instance, an element would not reject a request because of a
      malformed Date header field.
