If the proxy has a local policy that mandates that the request
         visit one specific proxy, an alternative to pushing a Route
         value into the Route header field is to bypass the forwarding
         logic of item 10 below, and instead just send the request to
         the address, port, and transport for that specific proxy. If
         the request has a Route header field, this alternative MUST NOT
         be used unless it is known that next hop proxy is a loose
         router. Otherwise, this approach MAY be used, but the Route
         insertion mechanism above is preferred for its robustness,
         flexibility, generality and consistency of operation. Furthermore, if the Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, TLS MUST
         be used to communicate with that proxy. If the copy contains a Route header field, the proxy MUST
         inspect the URI in its first value.
