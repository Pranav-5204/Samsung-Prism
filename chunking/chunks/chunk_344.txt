If the host portion of the "sent-by" parameter
   contains a domain name, or if it contains an IP address that differs
   from the packet source address, the server MUST add a "received"
   parameter to that Via header field value. This parameter MUST
   contain the source address from which the packet was received. This
   is to assist the server transport layer in sending the response,
   since it must be sent to the source IP address from which the request
   came. Consider a request received by the server transport which looks like,
   in part:
      INVITE sip:bob@Biloxi.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060
   The request is received with a source IP address of 192.0.2.4.
