Note that the value "render" is used
   rather than "inline" to avoid the connotation that the MIME body is
   displayed as a part of the rendering of the entire message (since the
   MIME bodies of SIP messages oftentimes are not displayed to users). For backward-compatibility, if the Content-Disposition header field
   is missing, the server SHOULD assume bodies of Content-Type
   application/sdp are the disposition "session", while other content
   types are "render". The disposition type "icon" indicates that the body part contains an
   image suitable as an iconic representation of the caller or callee
   that could be rendered informationally by a user agent when a message
   has been received, or persistently while a dialog takes place.
