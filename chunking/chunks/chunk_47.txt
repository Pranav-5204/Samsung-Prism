UAC Core: The set of processing functions required of a UAC that
         reside above the transaction and transport layers. User Agent Server (UAS): A user agent server is a logical entity
         that generates a response to a SIP request. The response
         accepts, rejects, or redirects the request. This role lasts
         only for the duration of that transaction. In other words, if
         a piece of software responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for
         the duration of that transaction. If it generates a request
         later, it assumes the role of a user agent client for the
         processing of that transaction. UAS Core: The set of processing functions required at a UAS that
         resides above the transaction and transport layers. User Agent (UA): A logical entity that can act as both a user
         agent client and user agent server. The role of UAC and UAS, as well as proxy and redirect servers, are
   defined on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
