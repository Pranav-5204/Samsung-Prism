A UAC MUST NOT re-attempt requests with the credentials
   that have just been rejected (though the request may be retried if
   the nonce was stale). 22.2 User-to-User Authentication
   When a UAS receives a request from a UAC, the UAS MAY authenticate
   the originator before the request is processed. If no credentials
   (in the Authorization header field) are provided in the request, the
   UAS can challenge the originator to provide credentials by rejecting
   the request with a 401 (Unauthorized) status code. The WWW-Authenticate response-header field MUST be included in 401
   (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at
   least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and
   parameters applicable to the realm.
