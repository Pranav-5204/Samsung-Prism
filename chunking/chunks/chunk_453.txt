An example of the Authorization header field is:
      Authorization: Digest username="bob",
              realm="biloxi.com",
              nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
              uri="sip:bob@biloxi.com",
              qop=auth,
              nc=00000001,
              cnonce="0a4f113b",
              response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1",
              opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"
   When a UAC resubmits a request with its credentials after receiving a
   401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response,
   it MUST increment the CSeq header field value as it would normally
   when sending an updated request. 22.3 Proxy-to-User Authentication
   Similarly, when a UAC sends a request to a proxy server, the proxy
   server MAY authenticate the originator before the request is
   processed.
