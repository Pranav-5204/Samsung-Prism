If a UA receives a re-INVITE for an existing dialog, it MUST check
   any version identifiers in the session description or, if there are
   no version identifiers, the content of the session description to see
   if it has changed. If the session description has changed, the UAS
   MUST adjust the session parameters accordingly, possibly after asking
   the user for confirmation. Versioning of the session description can be used to accommodate
      the capabilities of new arrivals to a conference, add or delete
      media, or change from a unicast to a multicast conference. If the new session description is not acceptable, the UAS can reject
   it by returning a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response for the re-
   INVITE. This response SHOULD include a Warning header field. If a UAS generates a 2xx response and never receives an ACK, it
   SHOULD generate a BYE to terminate the dialog.
