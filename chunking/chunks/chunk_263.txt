Record-Route
         If the selected response contains a Record-Route header field
         value originally provided by this proxy, the proxy MAY choose
         to rewrite the value before forwarding the response. This
         allows the proxy to provide different URIs for itself to the
         next upstream and downstream elements. A proxy may choose to
         use this mechanism for any reason. For instance, it is useful
         for multi-homed hosts. If the proxy received the request over TLS, and sent it out
         over a non-TLS connection, the proxy MUST rewrite the URI in
         the Record-Route header field to be a SIPS URI. If the proxy
         received the request over a non-TLS connection, and sent it out
         over TLS, the proxy MUST rewrite the URI in the Record-Route
         header field to be a SIP URI.
