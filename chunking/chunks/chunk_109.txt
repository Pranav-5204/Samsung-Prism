8.3 Redirect Servers
   In some architectures it may be desirable to reduce the processing
   load on proxy servers that are responsible for routing requests, and
   improve signaling path robustness, by relying on redirection. Redirection allows servers to push routing information for a request
   back in a response to the client, thereby taking themselves out of
   the loop of further messaging for this transaction while still aiding
   in locating the target of the request. When the originator of the
   request receives the redirection, it will send a new request based on
   the URI(s) it has received. By propagating URIs from the core of the
   network to its edges, redirection allows for considerable network
   scalability. A redirect server is logically constituted of a server transaction
   layer and a transaction user that has access to a location service of
   some kind (see Section 10 for more on registrars and location
   services).
