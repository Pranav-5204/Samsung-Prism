Generate CANCELs
         If the forwarded response was a final response, the proxy MUST
         generate a CANCEL request for all pending client transactions
         associated with this response context. A proxy SHOULD also
         generate a CANCEL request for all pending client transactions
         associated with this response context when it receives a 6xx
         response. A pending client transaction is one that has
         received a provisional response, but no final response (it is
         in the proceeding state) and has not had an associated CANCEL
         generated for it. Generating CANCEL requests is described in
         Section 9.1. The requirement to CANCEL pending client transactions upon
         forwarding a final response does not guarantee that an endpoint
         will not receive multiple 200 (OK) responses to an INVITE. 200
         (OK) responses on more than one branch may be generated before
         the CANCEL requests can be sent and processed.
