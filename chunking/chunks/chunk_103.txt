For further information on the
   processing of content-specific header fields, see Section 7.4 as well
   as Section 20.11 through 20.15. 8.2.4 Applying Extensions
   A UAS that wishes to apply some extension when generating the
   response MUST NOT do so unless support for that extension is
   indicated in the Supported header field in the request. If the
   desired extension is not supported, the server SHOULD rely only on
   baseline SIP and any other extensions supported by the client. In
   rare circumstances, where the server cannot process the request
   without the extension, the server MAY send a 421 (Extension Required)
   response. This response indicates that the proper response cannot be
   generated without support of a specific extension. The needed
   extension(s) MUST be included in a Require header field in the
   response. This behavior is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it will generally
   break interoperability.
