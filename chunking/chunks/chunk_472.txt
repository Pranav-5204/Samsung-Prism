If the certificate cannot be verified because it is
   self-signed, or signed by no known authority, the UAC MUST notify its
   user of the status of the certificate (including the subject of the
   certificate, its signator, and any key fingerprint information) and
   request explicit permission before proceeding. If the certificate
   was successfully verified, and the subject of the certificate
   corresponds to the To header field in the response, or if the user
   (after notification) explicitly authorizes the use of the
   certificate, the UAC SHOULD add this certificate to a local keyring,
   indexed by the address-of-record of the holder of the certificate. If the UAC had not transmitted its own certificate to the UAS in any
   previous transaction, it SHOULD use a CMS SignedData body for its
   next request or response.
