If the response to an OPTIONS is generated by a proxy server, the
   proxy returns a 200 (OK), listing the capabilities of the server. The response does not contain a message body. Allow, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, and Supported header
   fields SHOULD be present in a 200 (OK) response to an OPTIONS
   request. If the response is generated by a proxy, the Allow header
   field SHOULD be omitted as it is ambiguous since a proxy is method
   agnostic. Contact header fields MAY be present in a 200 (OK)
   response and have the same semantics as in a 3xx response. That is,
   they may list a set of alternative names and methods of reaching the
   user. A Warning header field MAY be present. A message body MAY be sent, the type of which is determined by the
   Accept header field in the OPTIONS request (application/sdp is the
   default if the Accept header field is not present).
