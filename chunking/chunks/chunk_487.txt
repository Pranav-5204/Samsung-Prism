If a SIP UA
   encounters an unknown header field with an integrity violation, it
   MUST ignore the header field. 23.4.2 Tunneling Integrity and Authentication
   Tunneling SIP messages within S/MIME bodies can provide integrity for
   SIP header fields if the header fields that the sender wishes to
   secure are replicated in a "message/sip" MIME body signed with a CMS
   detached signature. Provided that the "message/sip" body contains at least the
   fundamental dialog identifiers (To, From, Call-ID, CSeq), then a
   signed MIME body can provide limited authentication. At the very
   least, if the certificate used to sign the body is unknown to the
   recipient and cannot be verified, the signature can be used to
   ascertain that a later request in a dialog was transmitted by the
   same certificate-holder that initiated the dialog.
