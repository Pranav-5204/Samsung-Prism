Further, it is
         reasonable to expect that a future extension may override this
         requirement to issue CANCEL requests. 16.8 Processing Timer C
   If timer C should fire, the proxy MUST either reset the timer with
   any value it chooses, or terminate the client transaction. If the
   client transaction has received a provisional response, the proxy
   MUST generate a CANCEL request matching that transaction. If the
   client transaction has not received a provisional response, the proxy
   MUST behave as if the transaction received a 408 (Request Timeout)
   response. Allowing the proxy to reset the timer allows the proxy to dynamically
   extend the transactionâ€™s lifetime based on current conditions (such
   as utilization) when the timer fires.
