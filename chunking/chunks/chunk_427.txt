Both proxies and UAs MAY
   cache this URI for the duration of the expiration time. If there is
   no explicit expiration time, the address is only valid once for
   recursing, and MUST NOT be cached for future transactions. If the URI cached from the Contact header field fails, the Request-
   URI from the redirected request MAY be tried again a single time. The temporary URI may have become out-of-date sooner than the
      expiration time, and a new temporary URI may be available. 21.3.4 305 Use Proxy
   The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by
   the Contact field. The Contact field gives the URI of the proxy. The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the
   proxy. 305 (Use Proxy) responses MUST only be generated by UASs. 21.3.5 380 Alternative Service
   The call was not successful, but alternative services are possible. The alternative services are described in the message body of the
   response.
