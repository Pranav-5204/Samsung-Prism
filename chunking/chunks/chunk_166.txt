The UAC uses the remote target and route set to build the Request-URI
   and Route header field of the request. If the route set is empty, the UAC MUST place the remote target URI
   into the Request-URI. The UAC MUST NOT add a Route header field to
   the request. If the route set is not empty, and the first URI in the route set
   contains the lr parameter (see Section 19.1.1), the UAC MUST place
   the remote target URI into the Request-URI and MUST include a Route
   header field containing the route set values in order, including all
   parameters. If the route set is not empty, and its first URI does not contain the
   lr parameter, the UAC MUST place the first URI from the route set
   into the Request-URI, stripping any parameters that are not allowed
   in a Request-URI. The UAC MUST add a Route header field containing
   the remainder of the route set values in order, including all
   parameters.
