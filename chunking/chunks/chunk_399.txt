The sequence number MUST be
   expressible as a 32-bit unsigned integer. The method part of CSeq is
   case-sensitive. The CSeq header field serves to order transactions
   within a dialog, to provide a means to uniquely identify
   transactions, and to differentiate between new requests and request
   retransmissions. Two CSeq header fields are considered equal if the
   sequence number and the request method are identical. Example:
      CSeq: 4711 INVITE
20.17 Date
   The Date header field contains the date and time. Unlike HTTP/1.1,
   SIP only supports the most recent RFC 1123 [20] format for dates. As
   in [H3.3], SIP restricts the time zone in SIP-date to "GMT", while
   RFC 1123 allows any time zone. An RFC 1123 date is case-sensitive. The Date header field reflects the time when the request or response
   is first sent. The Date header field can be used by simple end systems without a
      battery-backed clock to acquire a notion of current time.
