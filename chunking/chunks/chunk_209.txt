The UAC MUST
   consider the session terminated (and therefore stop sending or
   listening for media) as soon as the BYE request is passed to the
   client transaction. If the response for the BYE is a 481
   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) or a 408 (Request Timeout) or no    response at all is received for the BYE (that is, a timeout is
   returned by the client transaction), the UAC MUST consider the
   session and the dialog terminated. 15.1.2 UAS Behavior
   A UAS first processes the BYE request according to the general UAS
   processing described in Section 8.2. A UAS core receiving a BYE
   request checks if it matches an existing dialog. If the BYE does not
   match an existing dialog, the UAS core SHOULD generate a 481
   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response and pass that to the
   server transaction. This rule means that a BYE sent without tags by a UAC will be
      rejected. This is a change from RFC 2543, which allowed BYE
      without tags.
