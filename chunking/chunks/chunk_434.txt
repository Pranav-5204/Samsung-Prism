The response MAY indicate a
   better time to call in the Retry-After header field. The user could
   also be available elsewhere (unbeknownst to this server). The reason
   phrase SHOULD indicate a more precise cause as to why the callee is
   unavailable. This value SHOULD be settable by the UA. Status 486
   (Busy Here) MAY be used to more precisely indicate a particular
   reason for the call failure. This status is also returned by a redirect or proxy server that
   recognizes the user identified by the Request-URI, but does not
   currently have a valid forwarding location for that user. 21.4.19 481 Call/Transaction Does Not Exist

   match any existing dialog or transaction. 21.4.20 482 Loop Detected

   The server received a request that contains a Max-Forwards (Section
   20.22) header field with the value zero.
