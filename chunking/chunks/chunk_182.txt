Concretely, the above rules specify two exchanges for UAs compliant
   to this specification alone - the offer is in the INVITE, and the
   answer in the 2xx (and possibly in a 1xx as well, with the same
   value), or the offer is in the 2xx, and the answer is in the ACK. All user agents that support INVITE MUST support these two exchanges. The Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327 [1]) MUST be
   supported by all user agents as a means to describe sessions, and its
   usage for constructing offers and answers MUST follow the procedures
   defined in [13]. The restrictions of the offer-answer model just described only apply
   to bodies whose Content-Disposition header field value is "session". Therefore, it is possible that both the INVITE and the ACK contain a
   body message (for example, the INVITE carries a photo (Content-
   Disposition: render) and the ACK a session description (Content-
   Disposition: session)).
